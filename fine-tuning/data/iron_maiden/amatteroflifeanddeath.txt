1. Different World

[Smith / Harris]



You lead me on the path

Keep showing me the way

I feel a little lost

A little strange today



I think I'll take a hold

Of whatever comes my way

Then we'll see what happens

Take it day by day



I though I had it all

I had it all worked out

Just what my future held

That there would be no doubt



But then the card came up

And I took another turn

But I don't know if it's

Fulfillment that I yearn



Tell me what you can hear

And then tell me what you see

Everybody has a different way

To view the world



I would like you to know

When you see the simple things

To appreciate this life

It's not too late to learn



Don't want to be here

Somewhere I'd rather be

But when I get there

I might find it's not for me



Don't know what I want

Or where I want to be

I'm feeling more confused

The more the days go by




2. These Colours Don't Run

[Smith / Harris / Dickinson]



It's the same in every country

When you say you're leaving

Left behind the loved ones

Waiting silent in the hall

Where you're going lies adventure

others only dream of

Red and green light this is real

and so you go to war



For the passion, for the glory

For the memories, for the money

You're a soldier, for your country

What's the difference, all the same



Far away from the land of our birth

We fly a flag in some foreign earth

We sailed away like our fathers before

These colours don't run from cold bloody war



Here is no one that will save you

Going down in flames

No surrender certain death

You look it in the eye

On the shores of tyranny you



Crashed the human wave

Paying for my freedom with your

Lonely unmarked graves



For the passion, for the glory

For the memories, for the money

You're a soldier, for your country

What's the difference, all the same



Far away from the land of our birth

We fly a flag in some foreign earth

We sailed away like our fathers before

These colours don't run from cold bloody war




3. Brighter Than A Thousand Suns

[Smith / Harris / Dickinson]



We are not the sons of God

We are not his chosen people now

We have crossed the path he trod

We will feel the pain of his beginning



Shadow fingers rise above

Iron fingers stab the desert sky

Oh Behold the power of man

On its tower ready for the fall



Knocking heads together well

Rise a city build a living hell

Join the race to suicide

Listen for the tolling of the bell



Out of the universe a strange love is born

Unholy union trinity reformed



Yellow sun it's evil twin

In the black the wings deliver him

We will split our souls within

Atom seed to nuclear dust is riven



Out of the universe a strange love is born

Unholy union, trinity reformed



Out of the darkness

Brighter than a thousand suns

Out of the darkness

Brighter than a thousand suns

Out of the darkness

Brighter than a thousand suns

Out of the darkness

Brighter than a thousand suns



Bury your morals and bury your dead

Bury your head in the sand

E=mc squared you can relate

how we made God

With our hands



Whatever would Robert have said to his God

About how we made war with the sun

E=mc squared you can relate

how we made God

With our hands



All the nations are rising

Through acid veils of love and hate

Chain letters of Satan

Uncertainty leads us all to this

All the nations are rising

Through acid veils of love and hate

Cold fusion and fury



Divide and conquer while ye may

Others preach and others fall and pray

In the bunkers where we'll die

Where the executioners they lie



Bombers launch with no recall

Minutes warning of the missile fall

Take a look at your last sky

Guessing you won't have the time to cry



Out of the universe a strange love is born

Unholy union, trinity reformed



Out of the darkness

Out of the darkness

Out of the darkness

Brighter than a thousand suns

Out of the darkness

Brighter than a thousand suns

Out of the darkness

Brighter than a thousand suns

Out of the darkness

Brighter than a thousand suns



Holy Father we have sinned




4. The Pilgrim

[Gers / Harris]



The keys to death and hell

The ailing kingdom doomed to fall

The bonds of sin and heart will break

The pilgrims course will take



Quelling the devils might

And ready for eternal fight

Aching limbs and fainting soul

Holy battles take their toll



Liberty and hope divine

Changing water into wine

So to you we bid farewell

Kingdom of heaven to hell



Spirit holy, life eternal

Raise me up take me home

Pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset

Onward journey begun



To courage find and gracious will

Deliver good from ill

Clean the water clean our guilt

With us do what you will



Then will my judge appear

Bear no false angel that I hear

For only then I will confess

To my eternal hell



Now give us our holy sign

Changing water into wine

So to you we bid farewell

Kingdom of heaven to hell



Spirit holy life eternal

Raise me up take me home

Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset

Onward journey begun




5. The Longest Day

[Smith / Harris / Dickinson]



In the gloom the gathering storm abates

In the ships gimlet eyes await

The call to arms to hammer at the gates

To blow them wide throw evil to its fate



All summers long the drills to build the machine

To turn man from flesh and blood to steel

From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach

From summer sends to Armageddon's reach



Overlord your master not your god

The enemy coast dawning grey with scud

These wretched souls puking shaking fear

To take a bullet for those who send them here



The world's all right the cliffs erupt in flame

No escape remorseless shrapnel rains

Drowning men no chance for a warrior's fate

A choking death enter hell's gates



Sliding we go only fear on our side

To the edge of the wire

And we rush with the tide

Oh the water is red

With the blood of the dead

But I'm still alive pray to God I survive



How long on this longest day

'Till we finally make it through

How long on this longest day

'Till we finally make it through



The rising dead faces bloated torn

They are relieved the living wait their turn

Your number's up the bullet's got your name

You still go on to hell and back again



Valhalla waits Valkyries rise and fall

The warrior tombs lie open for us all

A ghostly hand reaches through the wall

Blood and sand we will prevail



Sliding we go only fear on our side

To the edge of the wire

And we rush with the tide

Oh the water is red

With the blood of the dead

But I'm still alive pray to God I survive



How long on this longest day

'Till we finally make it through

How long on this longest day

'Till we finally make it through



How long on this longest day

'Till we finally make it through

How long on this longest day

'Till we finally make it through




6. Out Of The Shadows

[Dickinson / Harris]



Hold a halo round the world

Golden is the day

Princess of the Universe

Your burden is the way

So there is no better time

Who will be born today

A gypsy child at day break

A king for a day



Out of the Shadows and into the sun

Dreams of the past as the old ways are done

Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain

But we must endure it to live again



Dusty dreams in fading daylight

Flicker on the walls

Nothing new your life's adrift

What purpose to it all?

Eyes are closed and death is calling

Reaching out its hand

Call upon the starlight to surround you



Out of the Shadows and into the sun

Dreams of the past as the old ways are done

Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain

But we must endure it to live again



Out of the Shadows and into the sun

Dreams of the past as the old ways are done

Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain

But we must endure it to live again



Out of the Shadows and into the sun

Dreams of the past as the old ways are done

Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain

But we must endure it to live again



Out of the Shadows and into the sun

Dreams of the past as the old ways are done

Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain

But we must endure it to live again



A man who casts no shadow has no soul




7. The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg

[Murray / Harris]



Let me tell you about my life

Let me tell you about my dreams

Let me tell you about the things that happen

Always real to me



Let me tell you of my hope

Of my need to reach the sky

Let me take you on an awkward journey

Let me tell you why

Let me tell you why



Why should these curses be laid upon me

I won't be forgiven 'till I can break free

What did I do to deserve all this guilt

Pay for my sins with the sale of my soul

Demons are trapped all inside of my head

My hopes are gone reach for heaven from hell



My sins are many my guilt is too heavy

The pressure of knowing of hiding what I know

I'm able to see things

Things I don't want to see

The lives of a thousand souls

Weigh heavy down on me



I know they're crying for help reaching out

The burden of them will take me down as well

The sin of a thousand souls not died in vain

Reincarnate still in me live again



Someone to save me

Something to save me from myself

To bring the salvation

To exorcise this hell



Someone to save me

Something to save me from myself

To bring the salvation

To exorcise this hell



Someone to save me

Something to save me from my hell

A destination

Away from this nightmare



Someone to save me

Something to save me from myself

To bring the salvation

To exorcise this hell




8. For The Greater Good Of God

[Harris]



Are you a man of peace

Or man of holy war

Too many sides to you

Don't know which any more

So many full of life

But also filled with pain

Don't know just how many

Will live to breathe again



A life that's made to breath

Destruction or defense

A mind that's vain corruption

Bad or good intent

A wolf in a sheep's clothing

Or saintly or sinner

Or someone that would believe

A holy war winner



They fire off many shots

And many parting blows

Their actions beyond a reasoning

Only god would know

And as he lies in heaven

Or it could be in hell

I feel he's somewhere here

Or looking from below

But I don't know, I don't know



Please tell me now what life is

Please tell me now what love is

Well tell me now what war is

Again tell me what life is



More pain and misery in the history of mankind

Sometimes it seems more like the blind leading the blind

It brings upon us more of famine death and war

You know religion has a lot to answer for



Please tell me now what life is

Please tell me now what love is

Well tell me now what war is

Again tell me what life is



And as they search to find the bodies in the sand

They find it's ashes that are scattered across the land

And as their spirits seem to whistle on the wind

A shot is fired somewhere another war begins



And all because of it you'd think that we would learn

But still the body count the city fires burn

Somewhere there's someone dying in a foreign land

Meanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man

Tell me why, tell me why



Please tell me now what life is

Please tell me now what love is

Well tell me now what war is

Again tell me what life is



Please tell me now what life is

Please tell me now what love is

Well tell me now what war is

Again tell me what life is



For the greater good of God [x8]



Please tell me now what life is

Please tell me now what love is

Well tell me now what war is

Again tell me what life is



For the greater good of God [x8]



He gave his life for us he fell upon the cross

To die for all of those who never mourn his loss

It wasn't meant for us to feel the pain again

Tell me why, tell me why




9. Lord Of Light

[Smith / Harris / Dickinson]



There are secrets that you keep

There are secrets that you keep

There are secrets that you tell to me alone

I can't reach things I can't see

You don't see this strange world

Quite the same as me

Don't deny me what I am

Nothing hidden still you fail to see the truth

These are things you can't reveal

These are things you can't reveal



We are part of some strange plan

Why the slaughter of the brotherhood of man

Infernal sacrifice of hell

Fire breathing lead the way

Mounds of bodies as they all burn into one

Revenge is living in the past

Time to look into a new millennium



Spiral path leads through the maze

Down into the fiery underworld below

Fire breathing lead the way

Lucifer was just an angel led astray



Free your soul and let it fly

Give your life to the Lord of Light

Keep your secrets and rain on me

All I see are mysteries



Free your soul and let it fly

Give your life to the Lord of Light

Keep your secrets and rain on me

All I see are mysteries



We are not worthy in your black and blazing eyes

We gather demons in the mirror every day

The bridge of darkness casts a shadow on us all

And all our sins to you we give this day



Others wait their turn their lives were meant to last

Use yours wisely as the light is fading fast

Free your soul and let it fly

Mine was caught I couldn't try

Time returns again to punish all of us



We are cast out by our bloody fathers hand

We are strangers in this lonely promised land

We are shadows of the one unholy ghost

In our nightmare world the only one we trust



Free your soul and let it fly

Give your life to the Lord of Light

Keep your secrets and rain on me

All I see are mysteries



Free your soul and let it fly

Give your life to the Lord of Light

Keep your secrets and rain on me

All I see are mysteries




10. The Legacy

[Gers / Harris]



Tell you a thing

That you ought to know

Two minutes of your time

Then on you go



Tell tale of the man

All dressed in black

That most of them

Not coming back



Sent off to war

To play little games

And on their return

Can't name no names



Some strange yellow gas

Has played with their minds

Has reddened their eyes

Removed all the lies



And strange as it sounds

Death knows no bounds

How many get well

Only time will tell

Only time will tell



You lie in your death bed now

But what did you bring to the table

Brought us only holy sin

Utter trust is a deadly thing



To the prayer of holy peace

We didn't know what was lying underneath

So how could we be such fools

And to think that we thought you knew the answer



I can't begin to understand in all the lies

But on your death bed I can see it in your eyes

Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow

It really makes sense I can see it clearly now



Tangled up in a web of lies

Could have been a way to prophecies

Unaware of the consequence

Not aware of the secrets that you kept



Nothing that we could believe

To reveal the facade of faceless men

Not a thing that we could foresee

Now a sign that would tell us the outcome



You had us all strung out with promises of peace

But all along your cover plan was to deceive

Can it be put to rights now only time will tell

Your prophecies will send us all to hell as well



Left to all our golden sons

All to pick up on the peace

You could have given all of them

A little chance...at least



Take the world to a better place

Given them all just a little hope

Just think what a legacy

You now...will leave



We seem destined to live in fear

And some that would say Armageddon is near

But where there's a life while there's hope

That man won't self destruct



Why can't we treat our fellow men

With more respect and a shake of their hands

But anger and loathing is rife

The death on all sides is becoming a way of life



We live in an uncertain world

Fear understanding and ignorance is leading to death

Only the corpses are left

For vultures that prey on their bones



But some are just not wanting peace

Their whole life is death and misery

The only thing that they know

Fight fire with fire life is cheap



But if they do stop to think

That man is teetering right on the brink

But do you think that they care

They benefit from death and pain and despair
