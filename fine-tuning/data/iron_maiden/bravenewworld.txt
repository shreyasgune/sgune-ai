1. The Wicker Man

[Smith, Harris, Dickinson]



Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you

He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do

Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say

The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way



You watch the world exploding every single night

Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light

Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death

Hello to eternity and live for every breath



Your time will come, your time will come

Your time will come, your time will come



The ferryman wants his money you ain't going to give it back

He can push his own boat as you set up off the track

Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same

Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame



You watch the world exploding every single night

Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light

Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain

The shadow of the Wicker Man is rising up again



Your time will come, your time will come

Your time will come, your time will come



Your time will come, your time will come

Your time will come, your time will come

Your time will come, your time will come

Your time will come, your time will come




2. Ghost Of The Navigator

[Gers, Dickinson, Harris]



I have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey

On the bow I stand, west is where I go

Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray

As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray

Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun

But I know, but I know, but I know



I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost

As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost

As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea

The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me



Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves

Nowhere left to run, navigator's son,

Chasing rainbows all my days



Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been

Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so,

Nothing's real until you feel



I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name

Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain

I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind

For eternity I follow on there is no other way

Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun

But I know, I know



I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost

As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost

As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea

The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me



Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves

Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son

Chasing rainbows all my days



Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been

Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so

Nothing's real until you feel



I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost

As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost

As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea

The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me



Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves

Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son

Chasing rainbows all my days



Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been

Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so

Nothing's real until you feel




3. Brave New World

[Murray, Harris, Dickinson]



Dying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here

Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear

I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone

Mother love is no more, bring this savage back home



Wilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all

Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall

What you see is not real, those who know will not tell

All is lost sold your souls to this brave new world



A brave new world, in a brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world

In a brave new world, a brave new world

In a brave new world, a brave new world



Dragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now

Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh

Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth

You are planned and you are damned in this brave new world



A brave new world, in a brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world

In a brave new world, a brave new world

In a brave new world, a brave new world



A brave new world, in a brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world

In a brave new world, a brave new world

In a brave new world, a brave new world



Dying swans twisted wings, bring this savage back home




4. Blood Brothers

[Harris]



And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life

What do you think you'd expect you would see?

Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life

And in the river reflections of me



Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see

And in a movement he beckons to me

And in a moment the memories are all that remain

And all the wounds are reopening again



We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers



And as you look all around at the world in dismay

What do you see, do you think we have learned

Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray

Out in the streets where the babies are burned



We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers



There are time when I feel I'm afraid for the world

There are times I'm ashamed of us all

When you're floating on all the emotion you feel

And reflecting the good and the bad



Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?

Can you really tell me what life is?

Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you

Could be swept away by fate's own hand



We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers



When you think that we've used all our chances

And the chance to make everything right

Keep on making the same old mistakes

Makes untipping the balance so easy

When we're living our lives on the edge

Say a prayer on the book of the dead



We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers



And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life....




5. The Mercenary

[Gers, Harris]



Pay to kill, die to lose, hunted, hunter which are you

Diablo come again to make trophies out of men

Lose your skin, lose your skull, one by one the sack is full

In the heat dehydrate, know which breath will be your last



Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive



Show them no fear, show them no pain

Show them no fear, show them no pain

Show them no fear, show them no pain

Show them no fear, show them no pain



Human heart, human mind, intellect intertwined

Focus sharp in the night, watch the jungle burning bright

Toe to toe throw the line, everyone's caught hand tied

Iron will iron fist, how could it have come to this?



Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive



Show them no fear, show them no pain

Show them no fear, show them no pain

Show them no fear, show them no pain

Show them no fear, show them no pain



Show them no fear, show them no pain

Show them no fear, show them no pain

Show them no fear, show them no pain

Show them no fear, show them no pain




6. Dream Of Mirrors

[Gers, Harris]



Have you ever felt the future is the past, but you don't know how...?

A reflected dream of a captured time, is it really now, is it really happening?



Don't know why I feel this way, have I dreamt this time, this place?

Something vivid comes again into my mind

And I think I've seen your face, seen this room, been in this place

Something vivid comes again into my mind



All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation

Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more



The dream is true, the dream is true

The dream is true, the dream is true



Think I've heard your voice before, think I've said these words before

Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind

Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality

Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind



All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation

Coming to the realization that I can't see for sure



I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive

I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive

I only dream in black and white, please save me from myself



The dream is true, the dream is true

The dream is true, the dream is true



I get up put on the light, dreading the oncoming night

Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again

Nothing that I contemplate, nothing that I can compare

To letting loose the demons deep inside my head



Dread to think what might be stirring, that my dream is reoccurring

Got to keep away from drifting, saving me from myself



I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive

I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive

I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself



Lost in a dream of mirrors, lost in a paradox

Lost and time is spinning, lost a nightmare I retrace

Lost a hell that I revisit, lost another time and place

Lost a parallel existence, lost a nightmare I retrace



I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive

I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive

I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself



I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive

I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive

I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself



The dream is true, the dream is true

The dream is true, the dream is true




7. The Fallen Angel

[Smith, Harris]



Azazel is beside you and he's playing the game

Demons are inside you and they're making their play

Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time

For a devil to get ready and take over your mind



You and only god would know what could be done

You and only god will know I am the only one

You and only god would know what could be done

You and only god will know I am the chosen one



Could it be it's the end of our world?

All the things that we cherish and love

Nothing left but to face this all on my own

Cause I am the chosen one



Could it be it's the end of our world?

All the things that we cherish and love

Nothing left but to face this all on my own

Cause I am the chosen one



Beaten fallen angel but I've risen again

And the power is inside me, I've decided to pray

As I wait for Armageddon and it's coming my way

It's an honour to be chosen and I wait for the day



You and only god would know what could be done

You and only god will know I am the only one

You and only god would know what could be done

You and only god will know that I am the chosen one



Could it be it's the end of my world?

All the things that we cherish and love

Nothing left but to face all this on my own

Cause I am the chosen one



Could it be it's the end of our world?

All the things that we cherish and love

Nothing left but to face this all on my own

Cause I am the chosen one



Could it be it's the end of our world?

All the things that we cherish and love

Nothing left but to face this all on my own

Cause I am the chosen one



Could it be it's the end of our world?

All the things that we cherish and love

Nothing left but to face this all on my own

Cause I am the chosen one




8. The Nomad

[Murray, Harris]



Like a mirage riding on the desert sand

Like a vision floating with the desert winds

Know the secret of the ancient desert lands

Your are the keeper of the mystery in your hands



Nomad, rider of the ancient east

Nomad, rider that men know the least

Nomad, where you come from no one knows

Nomad, where you go to no one tells



Undercover of the veil of your disguise

The men that fear you are the ones that you despise

No one's certain what you future will behold

You're a legend you own story will be told



Nomad, rider of the ancient east

Nomad, rider that men know the least

Nomad, where you come from no one knows

Nomad, where you go to no one tells



No one dares to even look or glance your way

Your reputation goes before you they all say

Like a spirit that can disappear at will

Many claim of things but no one's seen you kill



Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious

Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us

Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands

No man's ever understood your genius



Those who see you in horizon desert sun

Those who fear your reputation hide or run

You send before you a mystique that's all your own

Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone



Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious

Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us

Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands

No man ever understood your genius



Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue

But no one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale

Some may say that you have killed a hundred men

Others say that you have died and live again



Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious

Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us

Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands

No man ever understood your genius




9. Out Of The Silent Planet

[Gers, Dickinson, Harris]



Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are



Withered hands, withered bodies begging for salvation

Deserted by the hand of gods of their own creation

Nations cry underneath decaying skies above

You are guilty, the punishment is death for all who live

The punishment is death for all who live



Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation

Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation

Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation

Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation



The killing fields, the grinding wheels crushed by equilibrium

Separate lives no more disguise, no more second chances

Haggard wisdom spitting out the bitter taste of hate

I accuse you before you know the crime it's all too late

Before you know the crime it's all too late



Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation

Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation

Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation

Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation



Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are



Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation

Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation

Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation

Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation



Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are




10. The Thin Line Between Love And Hate

[Murray, Harris]



When a person turns to wrong, is it a want to be, belong?

Part of things at any cost, at what price a life is lost



At what point do we begin, fighter spirit a will to win

But what makes a man decide, take the wrong or righteous road



There's a thin line between love and hate

Wider divide that you can see between good and bad

There's a grey place between black and white

But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes



We all like to put the blame on society these days

But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings



Sometimes take just more than that to survive be good at heart

There is evil in some of us no matter what will never change



I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever

Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever



Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad

Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane



At what age begin to learn of which way out we will turn

There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn



There's a thin line between love and hate

Wider divide that you can see between good and bad

There's a grey place between black and white

But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes



I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever

Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever



I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever

Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever



The thin line between love and hate



The thin line between love and hate
