1. Can I Play With Madness

[Smith/Dickinson/Harris]



Give me the sense to wonder

To wonder if I'm free

Give me a sense of wonder

To know I can be me

Give me the strenght to hold my head up

Spit back in their face

Don't need no key to unlock this door

Gonna break down the walls

Break out of this bad place



[Chorus:]

Can I play with madness - the prophet started at his crystal ball

Can I play with madness - there's no vision there at all

Can I play with madness - the prophet looked and he laught at me

Can I play with madness - he said you're blind too blind to see



I screamed aloud to the old man

I said don't lie don't say you don't know

I say you'll pay for your mischief

In this world or the next

Oh and then he fixed me with a freesing glance

And the hell fires raged in his eyes

He said do you want to knowthe truth son

- I'll tell you the truth

Your soul's gonna burn in the lake of fire



[Chorus 2 times]




2. Black Bart Blues

[Harris/Dickinson]



[spoken into]

[Bruce] 'What the fuck is that?'

[Nerd]

'Hi, guys, are you in a band or something? I mean it would be so cool if you were in a band 'cos you're Driving a big bus with band on the front of it'

[Bruce] 'Why don't you shut up and get on board will ya?'

[Nerd]

'Wow! I have it here you got a stereo and a microwave

And, and you got a beer, I'd like a Heineken if you've got one' that's real cool, that's great, yeah!'

[Bruce] 'Would you like to see Black Bart?'

[Nerd] 'Who's Black Bart?'

[Bruce] 'Let me introduce you'



Black Bart's seen it

Black Bart knows

Black Bart's done it

The Black Bart blues

Suspended in suspension

Many evil nights in Tennessee, and elsewhere

We all got to try the Black Bart blues



Black Bart's truckin' ain't what it seems

Black Bart's lookin'

Don't know where she's been

Maybe she's an acrobat

Spends her evenings dancing on a pole

We all got to try the Black Bart blues

Black Bart tried most anything

Black Bart liked it but he couldn't sing

So he asked me to tell ya

Try it for yourself and you will see

We all got to try the Black Bart blues



[spoken]

[Bruce] 'What did you do that for?'

[Nerd] 'I'm sorry, I just..., I guess I'm not used to...

[Bruce] 'Shut up and get on with it will you'



Black Bart's livin' across the ocean now

Black Bart's lookin' to come back somehow

So if you are a dancer,

You could dance his pole in May

That's a maypole



Black Bart's coming

Now Black Bart's gone

Black Bart did it so I wrote this song

Whatever and however,

In and out or several at a time mmm yes!

We all got to do the Black Bart blues

Here comes the guitar solo



We all got to try the Black Bart blues

Yowsa! Yowsa! Yowsa!




3. Massacre

[Lynott/Gorham/Downey, recorded by Thin Lizzy in the album Johnny The Fox]



At a point below zero 

There's no place left to go 

Six hundred unknown heroes 

Were killed like sleeping buffalo 

Through the devil's canyon 

Across the battlefield 

Death has no companion 

The spirit is forced to yield 

There goes the bandolero 

Through the hole in the wall 

He's a coward but doesn't care though 

In fact, he doesn't care at all 

The general that's commanding 

He's defending what he fears 

While the troops they are depending 

On reinforcements from the rear 

If God is in the heavens 

How can this happen here? 

In His name, they used the weapons 

For the massacre 

There is a point below zero 

Where the sun can see the land 

Six hundred unknown heroes 

Lay dead in the sand
