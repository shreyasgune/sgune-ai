1. Wildest Dreams

[Smith / Harris]



I'm gonna organize some changes in my life

I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past

I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road

I'm feeling ready to just open up and go



And I just feel I can be anything

That all I might ever wish to be

And fantasize just what I want to be

Make my wildest dreams come true



I'm on my way

Out on my own again

I'm on my way

Out on the road again



When I remember back to how that things just used to be

And I was stuck inside a shroud of misery

I felt I'd disappeared so deep inside myself

I couldn't find a way to break away my hell



When I'm feeling down and low

I vow I'll never be the same again

I just remember what I am

And visualize just what I'm gonna be



I'm on my way

Out on my own again

I'm on my way

Out on the road again



I'm on my way

Out on my own again

I'm on my way

I'm gonna breakaway




2. Rainmaker

[Murray / Harris / Dickinson]



When I was wandering in the desert

And was searching for the truth

I heard a choir of angels calling out my name

I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again

I turned my face towards the barren sun



And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me

And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves

And the cracks in our lives like the cracks upon the ground

They are sealed and are now washed away



[Chorus:]

You tell me we can start the rain

You tell me that we all can change

You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away

You tell me we can start the rain

You tell me that we all can change

You tell me we can find something to wash the tears.....



And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me

And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves

And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives

They are sealed and now far away



[Repeat chorus, 3rd verse]




3. No More Lies

[Harris]



There's a darkened sky before me

There's no time to prepare

Salvage a last horizon

But no regrets from me



Maybe I'll be back some other day

To live again just who can say

In what shape or form that I might be

Just another chance for me



A hurried time no disgrace

Instead of racing to conclusion

And wishing all my life away

No-one can stop me now



Time is up it couldn't last

But there's more things I'd like to do

I'm coming back to try again

Someday maybe I'll wait till then



No more lies...



They're all sitting at my table

Talking tall and drinking wine

Their time is up just like me

But they just don't know it yet



So just a word of warning

When you're in your deepest dreams

There's nothing you can hide from

I've got my eye on you



The clock is fast, the hour is near

Eventful past is everclear

My life is set, the time is here

I think I'm coming home



No more lies...



A hurried time, no disgrace

Instead of racing to conclusions

And wishing all your life away

No-one can stop me now



Time is up it couldn't last

But there's more things I have to do

I'm coming back to try again

Don't tell me that this is the end



No more lies...




4. MontsÃ©gur

[Gers / Harris / Dickinson]



I stand alone in this desolate space

In death they are truly alive

Massacred innocence, evil took place

The angels were burning inside



Centuries later I wonder why

What secret they took to their grave

Still burning heretics under our skies

Religion's still burning inside



[Chorus:]

At the gates and the walls of MontsÃ©gur

Blood on the stones of the citadel

At the gates and the walls of MontsÃ©gur

Blood on the stones of the citadel

At the gates and the walls of MontsÃ©gur

Blood on the stones of the citadel

At the gates and the walls of MontsÃ©gur

Blood on the stones of the citadel



As we kill them all so God will know his own

The innocents died for the Pope on his throne

Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal

Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross



Templar believers with blood on their hands

Joined in the chorus to kill on demand

Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty

To stand with the cathars, to die and be free



The book of Old Testament crippled and black

Satan - his weapon is lust

Leaving this evil damnation of flesh

Back to the torture of lies



The perfect ones willingly died at the stake

And all of their followers slain

As for the knowledge of God they had claimed

Religion's still burning inside



[Repeat chorus, 3rd verse]



Templar believers with blood on their hands

Joined in the chorus to kill on command

Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty

Still running heretics under our skies



As we kill them all so God know his own

Laugh at the darkness and in god we trust

The eye in the triangle smiling with sin

No passover feast for the cursed within



Facing the sun as they went to their grave

Burn like a dog or you live like a slave

Death is the price for your soul's liberty

To stand with the cathars and to die and be free



[Repeat chorus]




5. Dance Of Death

[Gers / Harris]



Let me tell you a story to chill the bones

About a thing that I saw

One night wandering in the everglades

I'd one drink but no more



I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight

Gazing up at the stars

Not aware of a presence so near to me

Watching my every move



Feeling scared and I fell to my knees

As something rushed me from the trees

Took me to an unholy place

And that is where I fell from grace



Then they summoned me over to join in with them

To the dance of the dead

Into the circle of fire I followed them

Into the middle I was led



As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear

But still I wanted to go

And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me

As I walked onto the coals



And I felt I was in a trance

And my spirit was lifted from me

And if only someone had the chance

To witness what happened to me



And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them

All had death in their eyes

Lifeless figures they were undead all of them

They had ascended from hell



As I danced with the dead

My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me

Below my undead body

Just danced the circle of dead



Until the time came to reunite us both

My spirit came back down to me

I didn't know if I was alive or dead

As the others all joined in with me



By luck then a skirmish started

And took the attention away from me

When they took their gaze from me

Was the moment that I fled



I ran like hell faster than the wind

But behind I did not glance

One thing that I did not dare

Was to look just straight ahead



When you know that your time has come around

You know you'll be prepared for it

Say your last goodbyes to everyone

Drink and say a prayer for it



When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed

And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead

When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed

And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead



To this day I guess I'll never know

Just why they let me go

But I'll never go dancing no more

'Til I dance with the dead




6. Gates Of Tomorrow

[Gers / Harris / Dickinson]



Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul

Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal

Ships in the night when they pass out of sight

Deliver their cargo of earthly delights



To the women and children, the souls of the dead

I've opened their book and no mercy is shed

You want forgiveness and you want it cheap

I don't give redemption rewards for the meek



Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame

There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself

You can't blame a madman for this, if you go insane

Give me the strength so I carry on



[Chorus:]

Trapped in the web - but I cut the threads

Show you the gates of tomorrow

Trapped in the web - no mercy is shed

Show you the gates of tomorrow

Trapped in the web - slaves to the dead

Show you the gates of tomorrow

Trapped in the web - but I cut the threads

Show you the gates of tomorrow



[Repeat 3rd verse]



[Chorus:]

Trapped in the web - but I cut the threads

Show you the gates of tomorrow

Trapped in the web - slaves to the dead

Show you the gates of tomorrow

Trapped in the web - no mercy is shed

Show you the gates of tomorrow

Trapped in the web - but I cut the threads

Show you the gates of tomorrow




7. New Frontier

[McBrain / Smith / Dickinson]



Bleeding you dry from the start

The sum of my parts

To give it away

New life in a day

Some new Frankenstein

Damned for all time



Cursed by the angel who fell

Who saves me from hell?

And who is my god?

And where is my soul?

Too tired to jump too young to run



[Bridge:]

Neverending, forever searching

Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart

Always seeking, always asking

Questions right from the start



[Chorus:]

Out beyond the new frontier

Playing god without mercy, without fear

Create a beast, made a man without a soul

Is it worth the risk - a war of god and man?

Is it worth the risk - a war of god and man?



I want to end my life now

But I don't know how

Recycled again a lifetime of pain

The spawn of a man

The devil has planned



[Repeat bridge, chorus]




8. Paschendale

[Smith / Harris]



In a foreign field he lay

Lonely soldier, unknown grave

On his dying words he prays

Tell the world of Paschendale



Relive all that he's been through

Last communion of his soul

Rust your bullets with his tears

Let me tell you 'bout his years



Laying low in a blood filled trench

Kill time 'til my very own death

On my face I can feel the falling rain

Never see my friends again



In the smoke, in the mud and lead

Smell the fear and the feeling of dread

Soon be time to go over the wall

Rapid fire and end of us all



Whistles, shouts and more gun fire

Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire

Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb

Be reunited with my dead friends soon



Many soldiers eighteen years

Drown in mud, no more tears

Surely a war no-one can win

Killing time about to begin



Home, far away

From the war, a chance to live again

Home, far away

But the war, no chance to live again



The bodies of ours and our foes

The sea of death it overflows

In no man's land, God only knows

Into jaws of death we go



Crucified as if on a cross

Allied troops they mourn their loss

German war propaganda machine

Such before has never been seen



Swear I heard the angels cry

Pray to god no more may die

So that people know the truth

Tell the tale of Paschendale



Cruelty has a human heart

Every man does play his part

Terror of the men we kill

The human heart is hungry still



I stand my ground for the very last time

Gun is ready as I stand in line

Nervous wait for the whistle to blow

Rush of blood and over we go



Blood is falling like the rain

Its crimson cloak unveils again

The sound of guns can't hide their shame

And so we die in Paschendale



Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire

Running straight at cannon fire

Running blind as I hold my breath

Say a prayer symphony of death



As we charge the enemy lines

A burst of fire and we go down

I choke a cry but no-one hears

Feel the blood go down my throat



Home, far away

From the war, a chance to live again

Home, far away

But the war, no chance to live again



Home, far away

From the war, a chance to live again

Home, far away

But the war, no chance to live again



See my spirit on the wind

Across the lines, beyond the hill

Friend and foe will meet again

Those who died at Paschendale




9. Face In The Sand

[Smith / Harris / Dickinson]



Everybody's waiting for something to happen

Everybody's waiting for something to see

Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters

Everyone's waiting for news on TV



Winding lives at the end of the spiral

Waiting dictators with their next big thrill

Everyone's looking, but no one is listening

Everybody wants to be in at the kill



I wait for the signs, they tell me true

I see the signs of the end of time



Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing

Everyone's looking for the reason why

Everyone's hoping for life everafter

Everyone's looking at death from the sky



Everyone's nightmares are going to happen

Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes

Everyone's praying but no one's believing

Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies



I wait for the signs, they tell me true

I see the signs of the end



[Chorus:]

So I watch and I wait

And I pray for an answer

An end to the strife and the world's misery

But the end never came

And we're digging the graves

And we're loading the guns for the kill



Can the end be at hand?

Is the face in the sand

Future memory of our tragedy?

Can the end be at hand?

Is the face in the sand

Future memory of our tragedy?



[Repeat chorus, last verse]




10. Age Of Innocence

[Murray / Harris]



I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more

I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart

I can't be sympathizing with a new lost cause

I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all



And all the politicians and their hollow promises

And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it

The working man pays everything for their mistakes

And with his life too if there was to be a war



So we only get one chance, can we take it?

And we only get one life, can't exchange it

Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it

The age of innocence is fading like an old dream



A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday

The victims' mind are scarred for life most everyday

Assailants know just how much further they can go

They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low



So we only get one chance, can we take it?

And we only get one life, can't exchange it

Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it

The age of innocence is fading like an old dream



You can't protect yourselves even in your own home

For fear of vigilante cries, the victims wipe their eyes

So now the criminal they launch right in our face

Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace



Despondent public worries, where it will all end?

We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend

We cannot even warn each other of evil in our midst

They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just



So we only get one chance, can we take it?

And we only get one life, can't exchange it

Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it

The age of innocence is fading like an old dream




11. Journeyman

[Smith / Harris / Dickinson]



From the red sky of the east

To the sunset in the west

We have cheated death

And he has cheated us



But that was just a dream

And this is what it means

We are sleeping

And we'll dream for evermore



And the fragment remains of our memories

And the shadows we made with our hands

Deep grey, came to mourn

All the colours of the dawn

Will this journeyman's day be his last?



[Chorus:]

I know what I want

And I say what I want

And no one can take it away

I know what I want

And I say what I want

And no one can take it away



But the memory still remains

All the past years not so strange

Our winter times are like a silent shroud

And the heartbeat of the day

Drives the mist away

And winter's not the only dream around



In your life you may choose desolation

And the shadows you build with your hands

If you turn to the light

That is burning in the night

Then the journeyman's day has begun



[Repeat chorus, 5th verse, chorus]
