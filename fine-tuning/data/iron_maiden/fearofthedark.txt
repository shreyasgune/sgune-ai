1. Be Quick Or Be Dead

[Dickinson/Gers]



Covered in sinners and dripping with gilt

Making you money from slime and from filth

Parading your bellies in ivory towers

Investing our lives in your schemes and your powers



You got to watch them - Be quick or be dead

Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head

You've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead

Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head....



Be quick !

Or be dead !

Be quick !

Or be dead



See... what's ruling all our lives

See... who pulling the strings...

See... what's ruling all our lives

See... who pulls the strings...



I bet you won't fall on your face

Your belly will hold you in place



The serpent is crawling inside of your ear

He says must vote for what you want to hear

Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're alright

Pull yourself stupid, rob yourself blind.



You got to watch them - Be quick or be dead

Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head

You've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead

Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head....



Be quick!

Or be dead!

Be quick!

Or be dead!




2. From Here To Eternity

[Harris]



She fell in love with his greasy machine

She leaned over wiped his kickstart clean

She'd never seen the beast before

But she left there wanting more more more



But when she was walking on down the road

She heard a sound that made her heart explode

He whispered to her to get on the back

"I'll take you on ride from here to eternity"



[Chorus: (2 times)]

Hell ain't a bad place

Hell is from here to eternity



She must be having one of her crazy dreams

She'd never sat on a piece so mean

I've made her feel like she's on cloud nine

She even thought she heard the engine sigh.



But like all dreams that come to an end

They took a tumble at the devil's bend

The beast and Charlotte they were two of a kind

They'd always take the line... from here to eternity



[Chorus 2 times]




3. Afraid To Shoot Strangers

[Harris]



Lying awake at night I wipe the sweat from my brow

But it's not fear 'cos I'd rather go now

Trying to visualise the horrors that will lay ahead

The desert sand mound a burial ground



When it comes to the time

Are we partners in crime ?

When it comes to the time

We'll be ready to die



God let us go now and finish what's to be done

Thy Kingdom come

Thy shall be done... on earth



Trying to justify to ourselves the reasons to go

Should we live and let live

Forget or forgive



But how can we let them go on this way ?

The reign of terror corruption must end

And we know deep down there's no other way

No trust, no reasoning, no more to say



Afraid to shoot strangers

Afraid to shoot strangers.




4. Fear Is The Key

[Dickinson/Gers]



We live our lives in fever

In choking sweat of fear

In the heat of the night you can feel so much

In the heat of the night I scream "Don't touch"



[Chorus:]

I remember a time when we used and abused

And we fought all our battles in vain

I remember a time we thought that passion was free

In the heat of the night... bodies aflame



We live in fever...



I hear your secret heartbeat

I can hear your silent cries

The kids have lost their freedom

And nobody cares till somebody famous dies...



[Chorus:]



Now we live, in a world of uncertainty

Fear is the key - to what you want to be

You don't get a say the majority gets it's way

You're outnumbered by the bastards till the day you die...




5. Childhood's End

[Harris]



I'd sail across the ocean

I'd walk a hundred miles

If I could make it to the end

Oh just to see a smile



You see it in their faces

The sadness in their tears

The desperation and the anger

Madness and the fear



[Chorus:]

No hope, no life, just pain and fear

No food, no love, just greed is here



Starvation and the hunger

The suffering and the pain

The agonies of all-out war

When will it come again ?



The struggle for the power

A tyrant tries again

Just what the hell is going on ?

When will it ever end ?



[Chorus:]



You see the full moon float

You watch the red sun rise

We take these things for granted

But somewhere someone's dying



Contaminated waters

Pollution and decay

Just waiting for disease to strike

Oh will we learn someday ?



No hope, no life, just pain and fear

No food, no love, no seed, childhood's end.




6. Wasting Love

[Dickinson/Gers]



Maybe one day I'll be an honest man

Up 'til now I'm doing the best I can

Long roads. Long days of sunrise to sunset

Of sunrise to sunset



Dream on brothers while you can

Dream on sisters I hope you will find the one

All of our lives, covered up quickly by the tides of time



Spend your days full of emptiness

Spend your years full of loneliness

Wasting love, in a desperate caress

Rolling shadows of night



Dream on brothers while you can

Dream on sisters I hope you will find the one

All of our lives, covered up quickly by the tides of time



Sands are flowing and the lines are in your hand

In your eyes I see the hunger, and the desperate cry that tears the night



Spend your days full of emptiness

Spend your years full of loneliness

Wasting love, in a desperate caress

Rolling shadows of night




7. The Fugitive

[Harris]



On a cold October morning

As frost lay on the ground

Waiting to make my move

I made no sound



Waiting for the mist to cover all around

I carefully picked my time then took the wall



I'm sick and tired of running

The hunger and the pain

A stop to look about then off again



Being at the wrong place

And at the wrong time

Suspected of a hit that was my crime



[Chorus:]

I am a fugitive being hunted down like game

I am a fugitive but I've got to clear my name



Always looking 'round me

Forever looking back

I'll always be a target for attack



Every morning onwards

Always on the run

Waiting for a sight of a loaded gun



[Chorus:]



Even if I find them

And get to clear my name

I know that things can never be the same



But if I ever prove

My innocence some day

I've got to get them all to make them pay



[Chorus:]




8. Chains Of Misery

[Dickinson/Murray]



There's a madman in the corner of your eye

He likes to pry into your sunlight

He wants to burst into the street with you and I

A world of shadows and of rain



He's seen what love is...

He wants to pay you back with guilt...



He lies to you he won't let you be

He's got your chains of misery

He won't be still 'til he's turned your key

He holds your chains of misery



There's a prophet in the gutter in the street

He says, "You're damned!" and you believe him...

He's got a vision but it shines out through your eyes

A world of hatred and fear...



He's felt what love means...

He wants to pay you back with pain



He lies to you he won't let you be

He's got your chains of misery

He won't be still 'til he's turned your key

He holds your chains of misery



He lies to you he won't let you be

He's got your chains of misery

He won't be still 'til he's turned your key

He holds your chains of misery



It's only love that holds the key to your hearts... only love...

It's only love



He lies to you he won't let you be

He's got your chains of misery

He won't be still 'til he's turned your key

He holds your chains of misery



He lies to you he won't let you be

He's got your chains of misery

He won't be still 'til he's turned your key

He holds your chains of misery




9. The Apparition

[Harris / Gers]



Now I'm here can you see me

'Cos I'm out on my own

When the room goes cold tell me you can feel me

..........'cos I'm here



Here I am, can you see me

Passing through, on my way

To a place I'd been to only in my dreams... before



In a world of delusion

Never turn your back on a friend

'Cause you can count your real true friends on one hand

..........through life



There are those that deceive you

There are those That'll let you down

Is there someone out there  that would die for you

..........thought not



Live your life with a passion

Everything you do, do well

You only get out of life what you put in

..........so they say



In a world of confusion

People never say that what they mean

If you want a straight answer go look for one

..........right now



In a room full of strangers

Do you stand with your back to the wall

Do you sometimes feel like you're on the outside

..........looking in ?



You can make your own luck

You create your destiny

I believe you have the power if you want to

..........it's true



You can do what you want to

If you try a little bit harder

A little bit of faith goes a long way

..........it does



Are we here for a reason ?

I'd like to know just what you think

It would be nice to know what happened when we die

..........wouldn't it ?



There are some who are wise

There are some who are born naive

I believe that there are some that must have lived before

..........don't you ?



As for me, well I'm thinking

You gotta keep an open mind

But I hope that my life's not an open and shut case.



Extra Sensory Perception

Life After Death, telepathy

Can the soul live on and travel through space and time ?



You know I feel so elated

'Cause I'm about to find it out

And when I know all the answers

Maybe then I'll come back

..........to fill you in



You don't be alarmed now

If I try to contact you

If things go missing or get moved around  ...it's me



And don't disbelieve it

No matter what your `friends' might say

We'll meet up again some place some way

..........one day




10. Judas Be My Guide

[Dickinson/Murray]



Lights out

We live in a world of darkness

No doubt

Everything's up for sale



We sleep

All of the world is burning

We pray to god for a better deal



Nothing is sacred back then or now

Everything's wasted

Is that all there is?

Can I go now?



Judas, my guide

Whispers in the night

Judas, my guide



Fight wars, die in a blaze of glory

Come home, meat in a plastic sack

Fall down

Better pray to your god for mercy

So kneel and help the blade cut clean



Nothing is sacred back then or now

Everyone's wasted

Is that all there is?

Is that it now?



Judas, my guide

Whispers in the night

Judas, my guide



Judas, my guide

Whispers in the night

Judas, my guide



[Solo]



I live in the black

I have no guiding light

I'm whispering in your dreams



Judas, my guide

Whispers in the night

Judas, my guide



Judas, my guide

Whispers in the night

Judas, my guide




11. Weekend Warrior

[Harris/Gers]



The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool

Who are you kidding being that cool ?



Trying to break away from running with the pack

But they ain't listening so you've gotta go back



You're a weekend warrior when you're one of the crowd

But it's over, just look at you now...



You're not so brave the way you behave

It makes you sick, gotta get out quick

It's all bravado when you're out with your mates

It's like a different person goes through those gates

And the game begins, the adrenalin's high

Feel the tension maybe someone will die...



[Chorus:]

A weekend warrior lately

A weekend warrior sometimes

A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore



You've gotta get out gotta get away

But you're in with a clique it's not easy to stray

You've gotta admit you're just living a lie

It didn't take long to workout why



It's hard to say why you got involved

Just waiting to be part, just waiting to belong...



[Chorus:]



Some of the things that you've done you feel so ashamed

After all it's only a game... isn't it ?

And after all the adrenalin's gone

What you gonna do on Monday ?



A weekend warrior lately

A weekend warrior sometimes

A weekend warrior maybe you were never like that at all.




12. Fear Of The Dark

[Harris]



I am a man who walks alone

And when I'm walking a dark road

At night or strolling through the park



When the light begins to change

I sometimes feel a little strange

A little anxious when it's dark



Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have a constant fear that something's always near

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have a phobia that someone's always there



Have you run your fingers down the wall

And have you felt your neck skin crawl

When you're searching for the light?

Sometimes when you're scared to take a look

At the corner of the room

You've sensed that something's watching you



Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have a constant fear that something's always near

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have a phobia that someone's always there



Have you ever been alone at night

Thought you heard footsteps behind

And turned around and no-one's there?

And as you quicken up your pace

You find it hard to look again

Because you're sure there's someone there



Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have a constant fear that something's always near

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have a phobia that someone's always there



Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark



Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark



Watching horror films the night before

Debating witches and folklore

The unknown troubles on your mind

Maybe your mind is playing tricks

You sense, and suddenly eyes fix

On dancing shadows from behind



Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have a constant fear that something's always near

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have a phobia that someone's always there



Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have a constant fear that something's always near

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have a phobia that someone's always there



When I'm walking a dark road

I am a man who walks alone
