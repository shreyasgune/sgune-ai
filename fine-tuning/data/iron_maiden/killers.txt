1. The Ides Of March

[Instrumental]




2. Wrathchild

[Steve Harris]



I was born into a scene of angriness and greed, and dominance and persecution.

My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen, I was never meant to be.

And now I spend my time looking all around,

For a man that's nowhere to be found.

Until I find him I'm never gonna stop searching,

I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around.



[Chorus]

'Cos I'm a wrathchild, well I'm a wrathchild.

Yeah I'm a wrathchild. I'm coming to get you, oooh yeah.



Say it doesn't matter ain't nothin' gonna alter the course of my destination.

I know I've got to find some serious piece of mind, or I know I'll go crazy.

But now I spend my time looking all around,

For a man thats nowhere to be found.

Until I find him I'm never gonna stop searching,

I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around.



[Chorus]




3. Murders In The Rue Morgue

[Steve Harris]



I remember it as plain as day

Although it happened in the dark of the night.

I was strolling through the streets of Paris

And it was cold it was starting to rain.

And then I heard a piercing scream

And I rushed to the scene of the crime

But all I found was the butchered remains

Of two girls lay side by side.



Murders in the Rue Morgue

Someone call the Gendarmes

Murders in the Rue Morgue

Run before the killers go free



There's some people coming down the street

At last there's someone heard my call

I can't understand why they're pointing at me

I never done nothing at all.

But I must have got some blood on my hands

Because everyone's shouting at me

I can't speak French so I couldn't explain

And like a fool I started running away.



Murders in the Rue Morgue

Someone call the Gendarmes

Murders in the Rue Morgue

Am I ever gonna be free.



And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law.

All France is looking for me.

I've gotta find my way across the border for sure

Down the south to Italy.



Murders in the Rue Morgue

Someone call the Gendarmes

Murders in the Rue Morgue

I'm never going home.



Well I made it to the border at last

But I can't erase the scene from my mind

Anytime somebody stares at me, well

I just start running blind

Well I'm moving through the shadows at night

Away from the staring eyes

Any day they'll be looking for me

'Cause I know I show the signs of...



Murders in the Rue Morgue

Running from the Gendarmes

Murders in the Rue Morgue

Running from the arms of the law



Murders in the Rue Morgue

Running from the Gendarmes

Murders in the Rue Morgue

Am I ever gonna be free



It took so long and I'm getting so tired

I'm running out of places to hide

Should I return to the scene of the crime

Where the two young victims died

If I could go to somebody for help

It'd get me out of trouble for sure

But I know that it's on my mind

That my doctor said I've done it before.



Murders in the Rue Morgue

They're never gonna find me

Murders in the Rue Morgue

I'm never going home.




4. Another Life

[Steve Harris]



As I lay here lying on my bed, sweet voices come into my head.

Oh what it is, I wanna know, please won't you tell me it's got to go.

There's a feeling that's inside me, telling me to get away.

But I'm so tired of living, I might as well end today.



[Repeat twice]




5. Genghis Khan




6. Innocent Exile

[Steve Harris]



My life is so empty, nothing to live for.

My mind is all confusion, 'cos I defied the law.

When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran.

I never had no trouble before this all began.



My life is so empty, nothing to live for.

My mind is all confusion, 'cos I defied the law.

When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran.

I never had no trouble before this all began.



I'm running away, no where to go.

I'm lost and tired and I just don't know. Yeah...

They say I killed a woman, they know it isn't true.

They're just trying to frame me, and all because of you. Yeah...




7. Killers

[Paul Di'Anno, Steve Harris]



You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back,

A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack.

Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed,

Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs.



My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise,

The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night.

I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed,

A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me.



I can see what a life's meant to be,

And you'll never know how I came to forsee, see, see.



My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties,

With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike.



Death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night,

Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!

I have found you, and now there is no place to run,

Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?!

Oooh yeah, I've done it!

YEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHH!



You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back,

A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack.

Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed,

Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs.

Oooh look out, I'm coming for you!

Ahahahaha!




8. Prodigal Son

[Steve Harris]



Listen to me Lamia, listen to what I've got to say.

I've got these feelings, and they won't go away.

I've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees.

Oh help me Lamia or I'm sure I'll die, oh please.



I feel unsettled, now I know that I've done wrong.

I've messed around with mystic things and magic for too long.

I feel I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me,

The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be.



I'm on my knees, oh help me please.

I'm on my knees, help me please.



Oh Lamia please try to help me.

The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be.

Lamia I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad.

The devil's got a hold of my soul, and it's driving me mad. Oh



Oh Lamia please try to help me.

The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be.

Lamia I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad.

The devil's got a hold of my soul, and it's driving me mad. Oh




9. Purgatory

[Steve Harris]



Thinking of an age old dream,

Places I have never seen,

Fantasies lived times before.

I split my brain, melt through the floor.



Over clouds my mind will fly,

Forever now I can't think why.

My body tries to leave my soul.

Or is it me, I just don't know.



Memories rising from the past,

The future's shadow overcast.

Something's clutching at my head,

Through the darkness I'll be led.



Oh another time, another place.

Oh another smile on another face.

When you see me floating up beside you,

You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you.



Please take me away, take me away, so far away.

Please take me away, take me away, so far away.

Please take me away, take me away, so far away.



Thinking of an age old dream,

Places I have never seen,

Fantasies lived times before.

I split my brain, melt through the floor.



Over clouds my mind will fly,

Forever now I can't think why.

My body tries to leave my soul.

Or is it me, I just don't know.



Memories rising from the past,

The future's shadow overcast.

Something's clutching at my head,

Through the darkness I'll be led.



Oh another time, another place.

Oh another smile on another face.

When you see me walking up beside you,

You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you.



Please take me away, take me away, so far away.

Please take me away, take me away, so far away.

Please take me away, take me away, so far away.




10. Twilight Zone

[Steve Harris, Dave Murray]



She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call.

But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all,

Because, you see, I can't take no shape or form.

It's been three long years since I've been gone.



I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry.

I'll never know the reason why I had to go.

Oh, oh, I'm crying,

Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me.

Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?

Ah can't you see me?



I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me.

I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's

Like to be hanging on the other side.

I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died.



I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone,

Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone.

Oh, oh, I'm crying,

Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me.

Oh, oh, oh, can't you hear me?

Ah can't you see me?




11. Drifter

[Steve Harris]



Walk away!



Look out now, baby won't you take me away,

Sittin' here its gonna be a new day.

Gotta sing my song and I can't go wrong,

Gotta keep on roaming, gotta sing my song.



What you feeling when you hold me tight?

I'm gonna cuddle up with you tonight, gonna get you feeling so secure.

Listen child don't you see there's a cure?

Anywhere got to get you away, feels so good think it's gonna be a new day.

I'm gonna get my song till I can't go on,

I'm gonna keep on roaming gonna sing my song.



I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along.

I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along.
