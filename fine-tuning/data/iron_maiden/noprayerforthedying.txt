1. Tailgunner

[Harris / Dickinson]



Trace your way back 50 years

To the Glow of Dresden, blood and tears

In the black above by the cruel searchlight

Men will die and men will fight

Yeah!



Who shot who and who fired first?

Dripping death to whet the blood thirst

No radar lock on, skin and bone

The bomber boys are going home



Climb into the sky

Never wonder why

Tailgunner

You're a tailgunner



Climb into the sky

Never wonder why

Tailgunner

You're a tailgunner



Climb into the sky

Never wonder why

Tailgunner

You're a tailgunner



Climb into the sky

Never wonder why

Tailgunner

You're a tailgunner



Nail that Fokker kill that son

Gonna blow your guts out with my gun

The weather forecast's good for war

Cologne and Frankfurt? Have some more!



Tail-end Charlie in the boiling sky

The Enola Gay was my last try

Now that this tailgunner's gone

No more bombers, one big bomb



Climb into the sky

Never wonder why

Tailgunner

You're a tailgunner



Climb into the sky

Never wonder why

Tailgunner

You're a tailgunner



Climb into the sky

Never wonder why

Tailgunner

You're a tailgunner



Climb into the sky

Never wonder why

Tailgunner

You're a tailgunner




2. Holy Smoke

[Harris / Dickinson]



Believe in me and send no money

I died on the cross, that ain't funny

But my so called friends are making me a joke

They missed out what I said like I never spoke



They choose what they wanna hear, they don't tell a lie

They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die

Saving your souls by taking your money

Flies round shit, bees around honey



Holy smoke, Holy smoke

Plenty bad preachers for the Devil to stoke

Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke

This is thirsty work making Holy smoke



Making Holy smoke



Jimmy Reptile and all his friends

Say they're gonna be with you at the end

Burning records, burning books

Holy soldiers, Nazi looks



Crocodile smiles, just wait a while

'Til the TV Queen gets her make up clean

I've lived in filth, I've lived in sin

And I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in



Holy smoke, Holy smoke

These plenty bad preachers for the Devil to stoke

Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke

This is thirsty work making Holy smoke



Holy smoke

Smells good



They ain't religious but they ain't no fools

When Noah built his Cadillac, it was cool

Two by two, they're still going down

And the satellite circus just left town



I think they're strange and when they're dead

They can have a Lincoln for their bed

Friend of the president, trick of the tail

Now they ain't got a prayer, 100 years in jail



Holy smoke, Holy smoke

Plenty bad preachers for the Devil to stoke

Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke

This is thirsty work making Holy smoke



Holy smoke




3. No Prayer For The Dying

[Harris]



There are times when I've wondered

And times when I've cried

When my prayers they were answered

At times when I've lied

But if you asked me a question

Would I tell you the truth

Now there's something to bet on

You've got nothing to lose



When I've sat by the window

And gazed at the rain

With an ache in my heart

But never feeling the pain

And if you would tell me

Just what my life means

Walking a long road

Never reaching the end



God give me the answer to my life

God give me the answer to my dreams

God give me the answer to my prayers

God give me the answer to my being




4. Public Enema Number One

[Murray / Dickinson]



When it all comes down the line,

And the lights they turn to greed

And you race off with your tires screaming

Rolling thunder,



And the people choke with poison

Children cry in fear

But you've got your fast bullet,

One way ticket out of here



Fall on your knees today

And pray the world will mend its ways

Get to your feet again

Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain



In the cities in the streets

There's a tension you can feel

The breaking strain is fast approaching

Guns and riots



The politicians gamble

And lie to save their skins

And the press get fed the scapegoats

Public enema number one



Fall on your knees today

And pray the world will mend its ways

Get to your feet again

Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain



A million network slaves

In an advertising new age

I don't need a crystal ball to sell ya



Your children have more brains

Than your drug-infested remains

California dreaming

As the Earth dies screaming



Fall on your knees today

And pray the world will mend its ways

Get to your feet again

Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain



Fall on your knees today

And pray the world will mend its ways

Get to your feet again

Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain




5. Fates Warning

[Murray / Harris]



Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive

And some of us are here just so that we'll die

How come the bullet hits the other guy

Do we have to try and reason why



Be it the Devil or be it Him

You can count on just one thing

When the time is up you'll know

Not just one power runs the show



Are we the lucky ones saved for another day

Or they the lucky ones who are taken away

Is it a hand on your shoulder from the Lord above

Or the Devil himself come to give you a shove.



Be it the Devil or be it Him

You can count on just one thing

When the time is up you'll know

Not just one power runs the show



A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away

A hurricane devastates the cities in its way

The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind

The worst is yet to come a hell to face mankind



Be it the Devil or be it Him

You can count on just one thing

When the time is up you'll know

Not just one power runs the show




6. The Assassin

[Harris]



Now the contracts out

They've put the word about

I'm coming after you



It's not the money I make

It's the thrill of the chase

And I'm coming after you



I watch your every move

Study the things you do

And the pattern of your ways



I watch the way you walk

I hear your telephone talk

I want to understand the way you think



[Chorus]

Better watch out, cos I'm the Assassin

Better watch out, Better watch out

Assassin



I'm in a cold cold sweat

I taste the smell of death

I know the moment's getting closer



And as you walk to the light

I feel my hands go tight

Excitement running through my veins



I've got you in my sights

I've got you dead to rights

The triggers waiting for my finger



I feel adrenalin rush

It's just the final touch

You can kiss your arse goodbye



[Chorus]




7. Run Silent Run Deep

[Harris / Dickinson]



The convoy lights are dead ahead

The merchantmen lay in their bed,

The trump of diesels hammers down,

In the oily sea - the killing ground,



Knuckles white, eyes alight,

He slams the hatch on the deadly night,

A cunning fox in the chickens lair

A hound of hell and the devil don't care



Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer,

Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare,

A silent death lies waiting for all of you below,

Running silent, running deep, sink into your final sleep



Chill the hearts of fighting men,

In open ocean wondering when

The lethal silver fish will fly

This boat will shiver, men will die



A cast of millions, a part of play

Killer? Victim? Or fool for a day

Obeying an order, men have to die

Us or them, a well-rehearsed lie



Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer,

Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare,

A silent death lies waiting for all of you below,

Running silent, running deep, sink into your final sleep



The lifeboats shattered, the hull is torn,

The tar black smell of burning oil,

On the way down to Davy Jones,

Every man for himself, you're on your own



The wolf eyes watch the crosswire

"Stern tubes ready", "Aim and fire!"

They can pin some medal on your chest,

But in two more weeks, dead like the rest



Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer,

Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare,

A silent death lies waiting for all of you below,

Running silent, running deep, sink into your final sleep




8. Hooks In You

[Dickinson / Smith]



I got the keys to view at number 22

Behind my green door there's nothing to see

Is that a feature, what kind of creature

Would hang around waiting for a guy like me



Stone-cold sober and sitting in silence

Laid back, looking for sympathy

I like a girl who knows where she's bound

I don't like girls who've been hanging around



Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling

For that well-hung feeling

No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love

I got the hooks screwed in



Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling

For that well-hung feeling

No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love

I got the hooks screwed in



She's tied up, she can't come to the phone

You must have got your wires crossed 'cause she ain't home

Knock on wood, you know I like that sound

She never could keep her feet on the ground



Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling

For that well-hung feeling

No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love

I got the hooks screwed in



Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling

For that well-hung feeling

No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love

I got the hooks screwed in



Hooks in you

I've got those hooks in you

Hooks in you, in you



Hooks in you

I've got those hooks in you

Hooks in you, in you



Right on the money, got it wrapped up tight

Got new ideas for the decor tonight

Make this house a preservation zone

Gonna set her in concrete, set her up on her own



Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling

For that well-hung feeling

No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love

I got the hooks screwed in



Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling

For that well-hung feeling

No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love

I got the hooks screwed in



Hooks in you

I've got those hooks in you

Hooks in you



Hooks in you

I've got those hooks in you

Hooks in you

I've got those ...hooks in you




9. Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter

[Dickinson]



Honey it's getting close to midnight

And all the myths are still in town

True love and lipstick on your linen

Bite the pillow, make no sound

If there's some living to be done

Before your life becomes your tomb

You'd better know that I'm the one

Unchain your back door, invite me around



Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter

Let her go, let her go, let her go



Honey it's getting close to daybreak

The sun is creeping in the sky

No patent remedies for heartache

Just empty words and humble pie

So get down on your knees honey

Assume an attitude

You just pray that I'll be waiting

'Cause you know, you know I'm coming soon



So pick up your foolish pride, no going back

No where, no way, no place to hide



Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter

Let her go, let her go, let her go




10. Mother Russia

[Harris]



Mother Russia how are you sleeping

Middle winter cold winds blow

From the trees the snowflakes drifting

Swirling round like ghosts in the snow



Mother Russia poetry majestic

Tells the time of a great empire

Turning round the old man ponders

Reminiscing an age gone by



Mother Russia

Dance of the Tsars

Hold up your heads

Be proud of what you are

Now it has come

Freedom at last

Turning the tides of history

And your past



Mother Russia

Dance of the Tsars

Hold up your heads

Remember who you are

Can you release

The anger the grief

Can you be happy

Now your people are free
