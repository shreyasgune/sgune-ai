1. Where Eagles Dare

[Harris]



It's snowing outside the rumbling sound

of engines roar in the night,

The mission is near the confident men

are waiting to drop from the sky.



The Blizzard goes on but still they must fly

No one should go where eagles dare.



Bavarian alps that lay all around

they seem to stare from below,

The enemy lines a long time passed

are lying deep in the snow.



Into the night they fall through the sky

No one should fly where eagles dare.



They're closing in the fortress is near

it's standing high in the sky,

The cable car's the only way in

it's really impossible to climb.



They make their way but maybe too late

They've got to try to save the day.



The panicking cries the roaring of guns

are echoing all around the valley,

The mission complete they make to escape

away from the Eagles Nest.



They dared to go where no one would try

they chose to fly where eagles dare.




2. Revelations

[Dickinson]



"O God of Earth and Altar,

Bow down and hear our cry,

Our earthly rulers falter,

Our people drift and die,

The walls of gold entomb us,

The swords of scorn divide,

Take not thy thunder from us,

Take away our pride."

[G.K. Chesterton: English Hymnal]



Just a babe in a black abyss,

No reason for a place like this,

The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,

An easy way for the blind to go,

A clever path for the fools who know

The secret of the Hanged Man - the smile of his lips.



The light of the Blind - you'll see,

The venom tears my spine,

The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.



She came to me with a serpent's kiss,

As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips,

Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,

So we lay in a black embrace,

And the Seed is sown in a holy place

And I watched, and I waited for the Dawn.



The light of the Blind - you'll see,

The venom that tears my spine,

The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.



Go



Bind all of us together,

Ablaze with Hope and Free,

No storm or heavy weather

Will rock the boat you'll see.

The time has come to close your eyes

And still the wind and rain,

For the one who will be King

Is the Watcher in the Ring.

It is You.

It is You.




3. Flight Of Icarus

[Smith/Dickinson]



As the sun breaks, above the ground,

An old man stands on the hill.

As the ground warms, to the first rays of light

A birdsong shatters the still.



His eyes are ablaze,

See the madman in his gaze.



Fly on your way, like an eagle,

Fly as high as the sun,

On your way, like an eagle,

Fly and touch the sun.



Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears

Looks the old man in the eye

As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd

In the name of God my father I fly.



His eyes seem so glazed

As he flies on the wings of a dream.

Now he knows his father betrayed

Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave



Fly, on your way, like an eagle,

Fly as high as the sun,

On your way, like an eagle,

Fly as high as the sun.

On your way, like an eagle,

Fly, touch the sun

On your way, like an eagle,

Fly



Fly as high as the sun.




4. Die With Your Boots On

[Smith / Dickinson / Harris]



Another prophet of disaster

Who says the ship is lost,

Another prophet of disaster

Leaving you to count the cost.



Taunting us with visions,

Afflicting us with fear,

Predicting war for millions,

In the hope that one appears.



No point asking when it is,

No point asking who's to go,

No point asking what's the game,

No point asking who's to blame,



'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,



If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,

If you're gonna try, well, stick around,

Gonna cry, just move along,

If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.



If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,

If you're gonna try, well, stick around,

Gonna cry, just move along,

If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.



13 the beast is rising,

The Frenchman did surmise,

Through earthquakes and starvation,

The warlord will arise,



Terror, death, destruction,

Pour from the eastern sands,

But the truth of all predictions

Is always in your hands.



No point asking when it is,

No point asking who's to go,

No point asking what's the game,

No point asking who's to blame,



'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,



If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,

If you're gonna try, well, stick around,

Gonna cry, just move along,

If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.



You're gonna die, die with your boots on,

If you're gonna try, well, stick around,

Gonna cry, just move along,

If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.



They die with their boots on,

Yes, they die.



The day, they die with their boots on

The day we die, we die, we die, we die, we die



No point asking when it is,

No point asking who's to go,

No point asking what's the game,

No point asking who's to blame,



'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,



If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,

If you're gonna try, try, stick around,

Gonna cry, just move along,

If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.



If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,

If you're gonna try, well, stick around,

Gonna cry, just move along,

If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.



Die!




5. The Trooper

[Harris]



You'll take my life but I'll take yours too

You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through

So when you're waiting for the next attack

You'd better stand there's no turning back.



The Bugle sounds and the charge begins

But on this battlefield no one wins

The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath

As I plunge on into certain death.



The horse he sweats with fear we break to run

The mighty roar of the Russian guns

And as we race towards the human wall

The screams of pain as my comrades fall.



We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground

And the Russians fire another round

We get so near yet so far away

We won't live to fight another day.



We get so close near enough to fight

When a Russian gets me in his sights

He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow

A burst of rounds take my horse below.



And as I lay there gazing at the sky

My body's numb and my throat is dry

And as I lay forgotten and alone

Without a tear I draw my parting groan.




6. Still Life

[Murray/Harris]



Take a look in the pool and what do you see

In the dark depths there faces beckoning me

Can't you see them it's plain for all to see

They were there oh I know you don't believe me.



Oh.....I've never felt so strange

But.....I'm not going insane.



I've no doubt that you think I'm off of my head

You don't say but it's in your eyes instead

Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool

Something draws me there I don't know what to do.



Oh.....they drain my strength away

Oh.....they're asking me to stay.



Nightmares.....spirits calling me

Nightmares.....they won't leave me be.



All my life's blood is slowly draining away

And I feel that I'm weaker every day

Somehow I know I haven't long to go

Joining them at the bottom of the pool.



Now.....I feel they are so near

I.....begin to see them clear



Nightmares.....coming all the time

Nightmares.....Will give me peace of mind.



Now it's clear and I know what I have to do

I must take you down there to look at them too

Hand in hand then we'll jump right into the pool

Can't you see not just me they want you too.



Oh.....we'll drown together

It.....will be forever.



Nightmares.....forever calling me

Nightmares.....Now we rest in peace.




7. Quest For Fire

[Harris]



In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth

When the land was swamp and caves were home

In an age when prize possession was fire

To search for landscapes men would roam.



Then the tribes they came to steal their fire

And the wolves they howled into the night

As they fought a vicious angry battle

to save the power of warmth and light.



Drawn by Quest for fire

They searched all through the land

Drawn by Quest for fire

Discovery of man.



And they thought that when the embers died away

That the flame of life had burnt and died

Didn't know the sparks that made the fire

Were made by rubbing stick and stone.



So they ploughed through forest and swamps of danger

And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts

In the search to find another fire

To regain the power of life and heat.



Drawn by Quest for fire

They searched across the land

Drawn by Quest for fire

Discovery of man.




8. Sun And Steel

[Dickinson / Smith]



Well, you killed your first man at 13,

Killer instinct, Animal supreme,

By 16 you had learned to fight

The way of the warrior, you took it as your right.



Sunlight, falling on your steel,

Death in life is your ideal,

Life is like a wheel



Through earth and water, fire and wind,

You came at last - nothing was the end,

Make a cut by fire and stones,

Take you and your blade and break you both

in two - break you both in two.



Sunlight, falling on your steel,

Death in life is your ideal,

Life is like a wheel rolling on and on.




9. To Tame A Land

[Harris]



He is the King of all the land

In the Kingdom of the sands

Of a time tomorrow.



He rules the sand worms and the Fremen

In the land amongst the stars

Of an age tomorrow.



He is destined to be a King

He rules over everything

In the land called "Planet Dune".



Bodywater is your life

And without it you would die

In the desert, the planet Dune.



Without a stillsuit you would fry

On the sands so hot and dry

In a world called Arrakis.



It is a land that's rich in spice

The sandriders and the "mice"

That they call the "Muad Dib".



He is the Kwizatz Haderach.

He is born of Caladan

And will take the Gom Jabbar.



He has the power to foresee

Or to look into the past

He is the ruler of the stars.



The time will come for him to lay claim his crown,

And then the foe

Yes, they'll be cut down,

You'll see

He'll be

The best that there's been,

Messiah supreme

True leader of men,



And when the time for judgement's at hand,

Don't fret.

He's strong

He'll make a stand

'Gainst evil

The fire that spreads through the land,

He has the power to make it all end.
