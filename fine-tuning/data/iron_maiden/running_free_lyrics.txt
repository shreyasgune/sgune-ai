1. Running Free

Just sixteen, a pickup truck, out of money, out of luck.

I've got nowhere to call my own, hit the gas, and here I go.



I'm running free yeah, I'm running free.

I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free.



Spent the night in an L. A. jail, and listened to the sirens wail.

They ain't got a thing on me, I'm running wild, I'm running free.



I'm running free yeah, I'm running free.

I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free.



Puller her at the Bottle Top, whiskey, dancing, disco hop.

Now all the boys are after me, and that's the way it's gonna be



I'm running free yeah, I'm running free.

I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free.

[Repeat]




2. Burning Ambition

So you think you can own me, well you'd better just think again

You'd better watch your steps now, woman, cause I ain't like those other men

There's something burning inside me that makes me want to be free

And when I get these feelings honey, you better keep away from me



There's things in life now, baby, that I know I've got to do

And I need your love now, baby, to help me see it through

So you think you can own me, well you'd better just think again

You'd better watch your steps now, woman, cause I ain't like those other men



[Solo]



So you think you can own me, well you'd better just think again

You'd better watch your steps now, woman, cause I ain't like those other men

There's something burning inside me that makes me want to be free

And when I get these feelings honey, you better keep away from me
