1. Senjutsu

Beat the warning the sound of the drums

Set the beacons afire for them all

Call to arms all the men far and wide

Have to fight now for dynasty pride at stake



The invaders repel from the north

Keep out nomads who come from the plains

Northern grasslands awash with them all

Blocking the tribes that invade from the south of us



Rallying round to the call

We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums

And they need everyone at the wall

So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall



Survive on ledges bitten in dust

Knowledge and virtue is stricken by lust

Really believe that they're coming for us

Dancing on graves

Of those who bled for us



Driven away by our endless desire

Defeat by anger and our greatest fire

Attack again and try as they might

Hold them again and see them running



Rallying round to the call

We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums

And they need everyone at the wall

So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall



Hear them coming - Ready now we wait

Must be steadfast - Must be patient



Must believe in - That we can win

What will save us - The great wall



Now under siege have the real strength to hold them now

Have to believe that we can repel them

Faith in the years our ancestors taught us

Have the belief that we can protect the wall



Try if they can we will overthrow them

Fight to the last they can never own us

Battle of wills we'll fight to the last man

Honour our dead so they never fought in vain



Hold our fortune - Avenge the merciful

Hold the great wall - Never fall again



Arrows falling - Dark oblivion - Live in spirit - Live to tell our sons



Rallying round to the call

We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums

And they need everyone at the wall

So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall




2. Stratego

How do you read a madman's mind

Teach me the art of war

For I shall bring more

Than you bargained for



Give me an ultimatum

That I could not dream of

Spills of a crying nation

Upon my soul



For I have not a mortal soul

That you already know

Look at my eyes

There's no surprise



Ocean is black the devil's track

Looking beyond beneath the sea

Eye of the storm is here again

Been there before you were ever born



Beyond the dark I feel the pain

It's hidden but I can't explain

A cross to bear

A heavy faith

My sorrow whispers

Time again



I hear you calling my name

Come to claim my life again

Pray for me I'm almost there

The pain almost too much to bear



I try to find my way back home

To feel the same again

The voice of nothing

Listened far too long



Little by little eat away

I think I've lost my mind

Too late to change now

What I left behind



Hear me listen my call

I am ready to fall

Lord hear me now - let me go



Ocean is black the devil's track

Looking beyond beneath the sea

Eye of the storm is here again

Been there before you were ever born



Beyond the dark I feel the pain

It's hidden but I can't explain

A cross to bear

A heavy faith

My sorrow whispers

Time again




3. The Writing On The Wall

Across a painted desert lies a train of vagabonds

All that's left of what we were it's what we have become

Once our empires glorious but now the empire's gone

The dead gave us the time to live and now our time is done



Now we are victorious, we've become our slaves

A land of hope and glory building graveyards for the brave



Have you seen the writing on the wall?

Have you seen that writing?

Can you see the riders on the storm?

Can you see them riding?

Can you see them riding?



Holding on to fury is that all we ever know

Ignorance our judge and jury all we've got to show

From Hollywood to Babylon ~ holy war to kingdom come

On a trail of dust and ashes ~ when the burning sky is done

A tide of change is coming and that is what you fear

The earthquake is a coming but you don't want to hear

You're just too blind to see



Have you seen the writing on the wall?

Have you seen that writing?

Can you see the riders on the storm?

Can you see them riding?

Can you see them riding, riding next to you?



Have you seen the writing on the wall?

Have you seen that writing?

Can you see the riders on the storm?

Can you see them riding?



Have you seen the writing on the wall?

Have you seen that writing?

Can you see the riders on the storm?

Can you see them riding?

Can you see them riding, riding next to you?




4. Lost In A Lost World

All is not it seems to be on the outside

Sometimes what appears to be is a show

What shows in the face is only a mirror

We all have some better places to go



We don't know just what we have 'til we've lost it

Until that time comes and know that it's gone

So hard to say things that we should have uttered long ago

Tear myself away from thoughts in my head



The people worshiping the sun

And all the children point up to the sky

They see the eagle as it floats on the wind

And they follow with their spirits high



Buffalo roam on the plain

We walk in to the flames but dance for rain

The hallowed dead in sacred ground and the elders

And we wash away their sins for them



Feel the spirits of the old ones standing proud upon their race

And the testament to ancestors ~ that are never to retrace

Burn the flame of innocence ~ as they ride into the sun

Thinking now of our forefathers that are lying dead upon

Holy ground and sacred earth now

Revisit stolen youth



Lost in a lost world

Buried on sacred ground

Lost in a lost world

Lying on sacred ground...



Lost in a lost world

Buried on sacred ground

Lost in a lost world

Lying on sacred ground...



Lost in a lost world

Standing on sacred ground

Lost in a lost world

Lying on sacred ground...



Will we ever heal our old wounds

Like forever darkness worn

Fighting for their lives again

So come on now don't be afraid



This is where destiny lies

Just to let us breathe again

Put upon this earth to wander

And to walk ~ forever lost



With the ashes of our enemies

To live among our ghosts

Of our past fear nothing

Life is but a better path to joy



Nowhere to go nowhere to run

Our whole nation overrun

Itself existence under threat

And soon will be none of us left



Remember names of all our dead now

In enemies that fled

Reaching for our sky forever free

A sadness that is proud



As the clouds all drift away now

Until we meet again




5. Days Of Future Past

A war in heaven in god's rage

He put me in this burning cage

Holy fury locks me in

Imprisoned by my deadly sin



Every hour the shadow king

Wonders what his clock will bring

I've lived and loved and that's for sure

My fatal quest forever more



The days of future past to wander on the shore

A king without a queen to die for evermore



To wander in the wasteland

Immortal to the end

Waiting for the judgement

But the judgement never ends



Once crucified you forgave it all

But my own life condemned to fall

Where's the glory in your name

My twisted soul still burns in flame



Hark you angels hear my call

Father witness to my fall

Between the lines of sin and pain

I walk the earth now doomed again



The days of future past to wander on the shore

A king without a queen to die for evermore



To wander in the wasteland

Immortal to the end

Waiting for the judgement

But the judgement never ends



The days of future past to wander on the shore

A king without a queen to die for evermore



To wander in the wasteland

Immortal to the end

Waiting for the judgement

But the judgement never ends



The days of future past to wander on the shore

A king without a queen to die for evermore



To wander in the wasteland

Immortal to the end

Waiting for the judgement

But the judgement never ends




6. The Time Machine

Put to the sword by an impish whim

Follow me now to a place we begin



Wrought with no anger, wrought with no fear

Devilish children playing here



Hidden in silence, below barren waste

Confusion hunger, am I still awake?



Have I ever told you about my time machine

Sit you down I'll tell you everywhere I've been



I have lived a long life, life extraordinaire

Let me tell you about it, let me take you there



Does it really matter, it's all in the mind

Let me tell you about it, listen what you'll find



I am not a preacher, I am but a man

You cannot imagine what I've seen and done



I have lived a long life, I have seen the world

I could tell you stories, hair will stand on end



Stand among the steeples, stand upon the walls

I have seen a god's face, I have no disgrace



I have seen the gods cry, howling in the wind

Where do I get started, when can I begin



I am not a preacher, I am but a man

You cannot imagine what I've seen and done



Sleep with a light that is dark to my eyes

Father and sons give me all of your lies



The brutal truth, that is never a lie

Full moon is out, as you look to the sky



I am not a preacher, I am but a man

You cannot imagine what I've seen and done



Open your heart and I'll open your soul

Even in quieter moments I know



I am not a preacher, I am but a man

You cannot imagine what I've seen and done



Eerie collection, darkness is there, wedded to danger

Betrothed to despair




7. Darkest Hour

We buried our sons, we turned and fled

No growing old, the glorious dead

But we came back because one man said

Now on the beaches the blood runs red



I faced them down, the only one

I stood alone and warned the day would come

But they were wrong, appeasers every one

And not for the last time, we all stand alone



I watch the sun move away as I embrace the night

And my black dog has its day for six long years you shall not pass

Barbarians at the gates, we will overcome



Here I stand in a serenade of glory

Naked by the throne of kings

You sowed the wind and now you reaped

The whirlwind before the dawn

The darkest hour

The darkest hour



To blaze in glory like a dying sun

One last burning giant till Jupiter moves on

Turn the ploughshares into swords

You sons of Albion awake defend this sacred land



Here I stand in a serenade of glory

Naked by the throne of kings

You sowed the wind and now you reaped the whirlwind

Before the dawn the darkest hour

The darkest hour



Here I stand in a serenade of glory

Naked by the throne of kings

You sowed the wind and now you reaped the whirlwind

Before the dawn the darkest hour



Here I stand in a serenade of glory

Naked by the throne of kings

You sowed the wind and now you reaped the whirlwind

Before the dawn the darkest hour

Before the dawn the darkest hour




8. Death Of The Celts

The road it winds uphill all the way

Ride to glory on this day

Remember now to do him so proud

In God we trust, cry it out loud



Redeem my salve of winning ways

Remember all the darkest days

Of that I know will see me tread

Walketh upon the field of the dead



The burden of blood, the breaketh of bone

The battlefield now I make it my own

The glory of the morning we make

Praying the rose is still awake



Lord above, my spirit says

Death is not proud, no more, no less

Power of my soul will be free

Deliver us on to victory



Wither a pain that's almost a joy

Wander there, my heart will destroy

Dreaming of days of our youth again

Strangely, no wonder memories remain

Pour thy scorn upon the realm

Pity me none at the gates of our hell

For I am but a messenger one

Sent to do reckoning, what must be done



Praying to our wretched doom

Liberty, freedom, maybe death looms

Wishing upon a fair display

Hoping our cause done, faithfully



Wayward thunder over rain

Giving me time to think again

Send to their graves on this day

Silent where the battle dead lay



Vengeance is for all who lay dead

I have no fear, my body has bled

I will live on in rebirth again

Come to me now, embrace it my friend



Spirits cry for a god from the grave

In darkness, fortune favours the brave



Dying, a warrior Celt has no fear

Immortal, for he will live evermore



Dying, a warrior Celt has no fear

Immortal, for he will live evermore



Think I am, that I'm almost there

Following now the depths of despair

Beyond the light, darkness will fall

Coming to take the life from us all



Following now where god can't explain

Bidding farewell, a lifeline again

Following those who came from hell

Came to witness the death of the Celts




9. The Parchment

When the moon will rise again

Until we read the Parthian skin

Broken fears warring days are here again



'Fore we all to dust descend

Heaven knows when life will end

God to know in the mire, put out the fire



Know there is a cross to bear

In your primal quest of fear

No quarter now is given no less



Aslumber was my main ideal

Asunder did my spirit steal

Sceptred race uttered words in disgrace



Sweet revenge will be ours

Vengeance of a shaken world

Just remember that patience is no sin



And to find another way

Live to breathe another day

Lord of light in the darkness, our guide



In a tempest never shaken

Edge of doom is not mistaken

Countenance is not a sin

Gallant king, we bow to him



Fierce as wolf with a leopard skin

Dark and bitter deep within

Invader punished with his life

Vanquished in the morning



Sea of blood in light divine

Unholy reverence enjoyed

Intoxicated with their hell

Man immortal sickness dwell



Savage beasts troops engage

Assembled here to butcher blades



Smoke has darkened in the air

Smell of death and deep despair



Wilderness a tyrant dream

Sell your soul not give them power

Slay upon imperial crown

Witness now the witching hour



Bound himself to oath and king

Such loyalty a shameless thing

Youth of agony still burn

Shedding parents blood



Never say a prayer to me

For this crime and treachery

Drinking from your cup of wisdom true

Many men will follow you



Now an army is raised

And our gods, they be praised

Death is but a gilted edge

Shall no more than we will pledge



Hear the cry we are ready to believe



The prodigal has returned

Give us our own revenge

With the power he learned

We will burn the same again



A betrayal of angels in a foreign land

A revenge for the merciful destiny at hand



For all those who have written

In the sand will be told

That the same will happen ~ searching for gold



Like a fire in the sky

I can feel strength return

Heading for afterlife, meet me there




10. Hell On Earth

Beginning of a sunrise bores a big hole in the sky

Not to reason why that

Armed children are in this world

And fighting in the name of God's way

Mourning bleak and utter waste

The vanity of the world is assured now



Prey upon the weak no more

The spirits of those who are gone

Propaganda of the battles

That are lost or won



And count your blessings still alive

Of those who managed to survive

Inside oblivion of that hell on earth



All you have been, all you have seen

Lost in somewhere in your dreams



How the angels they have fallen

All is nothing what it seems



In the voices that you hear now

In the voices in your head

Now are thinking of a lifetime

You can never feel again



I wish I could go back

Will never be the same again

Bled for all upon this hell on earth



And when I leave this world

I hope to see you all again

On the other side of hell on earth



Upon the eyes of good

I'm following the light again

In between the dark of hell on earth



On the other side, I'll see again heaven

So far away from this hell on earth



You dance on the graves who bled for us

Do you really think they'll come for us

Knowledge and virtue taken by lust

Live on the edge of those that you trust



You think that you have all the answers for all

In your arrogant way only one way to fall

Burning a lamp that is fire in your hands

Taking you further from these lands



Love in anger, life in danger

Lost in anger, life in danger



Love in anger, life in danger

Lost in anger, life in danger
