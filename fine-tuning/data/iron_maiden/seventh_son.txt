1. Moonchild

[Smith / Dickinson]

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins

Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires

I am he, the bornless one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude

Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth-strangled babe
Be the Devil's own, Lucifer's my name

Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal

I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones. I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned

And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death

Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon, child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight

The twins. They are exhausted. Seven is this night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die

One more dies and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give

A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you, young man
But I see you damned in endless night

Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon, child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight


2. Infinite Dreams

[Harris]

Infinite dreams I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams

Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing I cannot move
Standing rigid a nightmare's statue
What a dream when will it end
And will it transcend?

Restless sleep the minds in turmoil
One nightmare ends another fertile
It's getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep.

Even though it's reached new heights
I'd rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder it makes me think
There's more to this I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?

Can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualists? Well me I'm neither
Wouldn't you like to know the truth?
Oh what's out there to have the proof
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?

Help me. Help me to find my true
Self without seeing the future
Save me, save me from torturing
Myself even within my dreams

There's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again.


3. Can I Play With Madness?

[Smith / Dickinson / Harris]

Can I play with madness?

Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place

[Chorus]
Can I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha) He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to see

Said you're too blind to see

I screamed aloud to the old man
I said don't lie, don't say you don't know
I say you'll pay for this mischief
In this world or the next
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said you wanna know the truth son?
Lord, I'll tell you the truth
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire

[Chorus]

Listen to me, said the prophet

[Chorus]

Can I play with madness?


4. The Evil That Men Do

[Smith / Dickinson / Harris]

Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter, her eyes red with
The slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her.
I will call her name out loud.
I would bleed for her.
If I could only see her now.

Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge.
Living on a razor's edge on...
Balancing on a ledge on...
Balancing on a ledge on...
Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge you know ... you know !!

The evil that men do lives on and on !....[x4]

Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me.
And I will pray for you.
...Some day I may return.
Don't you cry for me
Beyond is where I learn.

Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge.
Living on a razor's edge you know... you know !!

The evil that men do lives on and on! [x4]

Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge.
Living on a razor's edge you know ... you know !!

The evil that men do lives on and on! [x4]
The evil !
The evil !
The evil that men do...
The evil !
The evil !
The evil that men do...
Yeah yeah!!


5. Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son

[Harris]

Here they stand brothers them all
All the sons divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one.

Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds

[Chorus:]
Seventh son of a seventh son [4 times]

Then they watch the progress he makes
The Good and the evil which path will he take
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers before it's too late

[Chorus:]

Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done


6. The Prophecy

[Murray / Harris]

Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed
Why won't you listen to me
Is it so hard to understand
That I am the real seventh son
Your life or death on me depends

Suffering and pain impending disaster
Souls crying the devil's laughter
Heard the cry of the seventh whistlers
Lucifer smiles looks on and waits

I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate your fortune's in my visions
Heed what I say and you'll see what
What will be
Please listen to me

Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame unto me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment
It stays with me knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed

Purgatory beckons souls lost forever
Life after death or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
Now Lucifer laughs hell awaits

I had their lives in my hands
Their fates their fortunes in my visions
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late.


7. The Clairvoyant

[Harris]

Feel the sweat break on my brow.
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls?
Is this dream or is it now?
Is this a vision or normality I see before my eyes?

I wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems the powers getting stronger every day.
I feel a strength an inner fire,
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore.

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker.
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying?

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker.
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying?

Just by looking through your eyes,
He could see the future penetrating right in through your mind,
See the truth and see your lies,
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise.

There's time to live and time to die.
When it's time to meet the maker.
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying?

There's time to live and time to die.
When it's time to meet the maker.
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying?

And be reborn again.


8. Only The Good Die Young

[Harris / Dickinson]

The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed

Time it waits for no man
My future it is revealed
Time it waits for no man
My fate is sealed

If I cancel tomorrow the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of the prophets I mock your morality plays

The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an end game, one more stalemate

Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us?
And look through our eyes?

Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin does is measure up to your lust?

So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time
Have a good sin

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell

Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires
