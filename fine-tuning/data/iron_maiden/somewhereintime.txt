1. Caught Somewhere In Time

[(Harris) 7:22]



If you had the time to lose

An open mind and time to choose

Would you care to take a look

Or can you read me like a book



Time is always on my side

Time is always on my side



Can I tempt you come with me

Be Devil may care fulfill your dream

If I said I'd take you there

Would you go would you be scared



Time is always on my side

Time is always on my side



Don't be afraid you're safe with me

Safe as any soul can be... honestly

Just let yourself go



[Chorus:]

Caught somewhere in time

Caught somewhere in time

Caught somewhere in time... oh oh

Caught somewhere in time

Caught somewhere in time

Caught somewhere in time... oh oh



Like a wolf in sheep's clothing

You try to hide your deepest sins

Of all the things that you've done wrong

And I know where you belong



Time is always on my side

Time is always on my side



Make you an offer you can't refuse

You've only got your soul to lose...

Eternally... let yourself go!



[Chorus:]

Caught somewhere in time

Caught somewhere in time

Caught somewhere in time... oh oh

Caught somewhere in time

Caught somewhere in time

Caught now in two minds!




2. Wasted Years

[(Smith) 5:06]



From the coast of gold, across the seven seas

I'm travellin' on, far and wide

But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself

And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but

someone else



I close my eyes, and think of home

Another city goes by in the night

Ain't it funny how it is, you never miss it 'til it's

gone away

And my heart is lying there and will be 'til my

dying day



[Chorus:]

So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for

those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

And realise you're living in the golden years



Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind

Can't ease this pain, so easily

When you can't find the words to say it's hard to

make it through another day

And it makes me wanna cry and throw my

hands up to the sky



[Chorus:]




3. Sea Of Madness

[(Smith) 5:42]



Out in the street somebody's crying

Out in the night the fires burn

Maybe tonight somebody's crying

Reached the point of no return

Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe

Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave



[Chorus:]

Like the eagle and the dove

Fly so high on wings above

When all you see can only bring you sadness

Like a river we will flow

On towards the sea we go

When all you do can only bring you sadness

Out on the sea of madness



Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling

Out in the dark there burns a dream

You got to hope when you are falling

To find the world that you have seen

Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe

Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave



[Chorus:]



It's madness

The sun don't shine

On the sea of madness

There ain't no wind to fill your sails

Madness when all you see can only bring you sadness

On towards the sea we go...



Out in the street somebody's crying

Out in the night the fires burn

Maybe tonight somebody's crying

Reached the point of no return

Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe

Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave



[Chorus:]




4. Heaven Can Wait

[(Harris) 7:24]



Can't understand what is happening to me

This isn't real this is only a dream

But I never have felt, no I never have felt this

way before

I'm looking down on my body below

I lie asleep in the midst of a dream

Is it now could it be the Angel of Death has come for me

I can't believe that really my time has come

I don't feel ready there's so much left undone

And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away



[Chorus:]

Heaven can wait / Heaven can wait

Heaven can wait / Heaven can wait 'til another day



I have a lust for the Earth below

And Hell itself is my only foe

'Cause I've no fear of dying

I'll go when I'm good and ready

I snatch a glimpse of the lights eternal rays

I see a tunnel I stand amazed

At all of the people standing there in front of me

Into the paths of rightness I'll be led

Is this the place where the living join the dead

I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare



[Chorus:]



Take my hand I'll lead you to the promised land

Take my hand I'll give you immortality

Eternal youth I'll take you to the other side

To see the truth the path for you is decided



My body tingles I feel so strange

I feel so tired I feel so drained

And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again

Is this in limbo or Heaven or Hell

Maybe I'm going down there as well

I can't accept my soul will drift forever

I feel myself floating back down to Earth

So could this be the hour of my rebirth

Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?



[Chorus:]




5. The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner

[(Harris) 6:31]



The tough of the track

With the wind

And the rain that's beating down on

Your back

Your heart's beating loud

And goes on getting louder

And goes on even more 'til the

Sound is ringing in your head

With every step you tread

And every breath you take

Determination

Makes you run never stop

Got to win got to run 'til you drop

Keep the pace hold the race

Your mind is getting clearer

You're over half way there

But the miles they never seem to end

As if you're in a dream

Not getting anywhere

It seems so futile



[Chorus]

Run on and on

Run on and on

The loneliness of the long distance runner



I've got to keep running the course

I've got to keep running and win at

All costs

I've got to keep going be strong

Must be so determined and push myself on



Run over stiles across fields

Turn to look at who's on your heels

Way ahead of the field

The line is getting nearer but do

You want the glory that goes

You reach the final stretch

Ideals are just a trace

You feel like throwing the race

It's all so futile



[Chorus:]




6. Stranger In A Strange Land

[(Smith) 5:43]



Was many years ago that I left home and came this way

I was a young man, full of hope and dreams

But now it seems to me that all is lost and

nothing gained

Sometimes things ain't what they seem

No brave new world, no brave new world

No brave new world, no brave new world



Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky

My spirit wanders endlessly

Until the day will dawn and friends from home

discover why

Hear me calling, rescue me

Set me free, set me free

Lost in this place, and leave no trace



[Chorus:]

Stranger in a strange land

Land of ice and snow

Trapped inside this prison

Lost and far from home



One hundred years have gone and men again

they came that way

To find the answer to the mystery

They found his body lying where it fell all that day

Preserved in time for all to see

No brave new world, no brave new world

Lost in this place, and leave no trace



What became of the man that started

All are gone and their souls departed

Left me here in this place

So all alone



[Chorus:]



What became of the man that started

All are gone and their souls departed

Left me here in this place

So all alone



[Chorus:]




7. Deja-Vu

[(Murray-Harris) 4:55]



When you see familiar faces

But you don't remember where they're from

Could you be wrong?



When you've been particular places

That you know you've never been before

Can you be sure?



'Cause you know this has happened before

And you know that this moment in time is for real

And you know when you feel deja-vu



[Chorus:]

Feel like I've been here before

Feel like I've been here before

Feel like I've been here before

Feel like I've been here before



Ever had a conversation

That you realise you've had before

Isn't it strange



Have you ever talked to someone

And you feel you know what's coming next

It feels pre-arranged



'Cause you know that you've heard it before

And you feel that this moment in time is surreal

'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu



[Chorus:]




8. Alexander The Great

[(Harris) 8:35]



"My son ask for thyself another

Kingdom, for that which I leave

is too small for thee"

(King Philip of Macedonia - 339 B.C.)



Near to the east

In a part of ancient Greece

In an ancient land called Macedonia

Was born a son

To Philip of Macedon

The legend his name was Alexander



At the age of nineteen

He became the Macedon King

And he swore to free all of Asia Minor

By the Aegian Sea

In 334 B.C.

He utterly beat the armies of Persia



[Chorus:]

Alexander the Great

His name struck fear into hearts of men

Alexander the Great

Became a legend 'mongst mortal men



King Darius the third

Defeated fled Persia

The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes

Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well

And he founded the city called Alexandria



By the Tigris river

He met King Darius again

And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela

Entering Babylon

And Susa, treasures he found

Took Persepolis the capital of Persia



[Chorus:]

Alexander the Great

His name struck fear into hearts of men

Alexander the Great

Became a God amongst mortal men



A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke

And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'

And legend said that who untied the knot

He would become the master of Asia



Hellenism he spread far and wide

The Macedonian learned mind

Their culture was a western way of life

He paved the way for Christianity



Marching on, marching on

The battle weary marching side by side

Alexander's army line by line

They wouldn't follow him to India

Tired of the combat, pain and the glory



Alexander the Great

His name struck fear into hearts of men

Alexander the Great

He died of fever in Babylon
