1. If Eternity Should Fail

[Dickinson]



Here is the soul of a man

Here in this place for the taking

Clothed in white, stand in the light

Here is the soul of a man



Time to speak with the shaman again

Conjure the jester again

Black dog in the ruins is howling my name

So here is the soul of a man



When the world was virgin

Before the coming of men

Just a solar witness

The beginning of the end

From a world of magma

To a cold rock face

The ascent of madness

And a human race



We are strange believers, all of us

There are stranger truths, immortal lust

We rise from slumber, he calls our name

Recalls our number, abide with pain



Reef in a sail at the edge of the world

If eternity should fail

Waiting in line for the ending of time

If eternity should fail



Reef in a sail at the edge of the world

If eternity should fail

Waiting in line for the ending of time

If eternity should fail



To God's illusion

Which I recall

Was our delusion

Before the fall

The angels come and the angels go

But the lord of light shining below



Eternal blackness beyond the stars

We think our wisdom will get that far

At the master's table, the table's bare

No land of plenty, devastation, despair



Reef in a sail at the edge of the world

If eternity should fail

Waiting in line for the ending of time

If eternity should fail



Reef in a sail at the edge of the world

If eternity should fail

Waiting in line for the ending of time

If eternity should fail



Reef in a sail at the edge of the world

If eternity should fail

Waiting in line for the ending of time

If eternity should fail



Reef in a sail at the edge of the world

If eternity should fail

Waiting in line for the ending of time

If eternity should fail



Reef in a sail at the edge of the world

If eternity should fail

Waiting in line for the ending of time

If eternity should fail



Reef in a sail at the edge of the world

If eternity should fail

Waiting in line for the ending of time

If eternity should fail



Good day, my name is Necropolis

I am formed of the dead

I am the harvester of the soul meat

And I suck the lives from around my bed

My own two sons I gave them breath

And I filled their living corpses with my bile

What humanity I knew I have long forgotten

For me eternity is nothing

But a short while




2. Speed Of Light

[Smith / Dickinson]



Another time, another place

A hollow universe in space

I took a trip to see the sights

I will be blacker than the night



One way ticket, no returns

My shooting starâso fast it burns

On the edge that you can't see

Let's shot the moon, you and me

I'm not particular you see

Just a lonesome galaxy



Shadows in the stars

We will not return

Humanity won't save us

At the speed of light

Shadows in the stars

We will not return

Humanity won't save us

We slip into the night



I'll say a mass for you and wave

Shootin' plasma from my grave

Event horizon lost in space

Runnin' in a human race



I don't know where, I don't know when

But somehow back there time again

I'm on the edge that you can't see

I'm not particular at night

A single particle of me

You won't be trackin' me by sight



Shadows in the stars

We will not return

Humanity won't save us

At the speed of light

Shadows in the stars

We will not return

Humanity won't save us

At the speed of light



We slip into the night




3. The Great Unknown

[Smith / Harris]



Winter softly falling to the ground

Calmly waiting, don't you hear a sound?



When the world has fallen to the depths below

Where the future's open and the fear has grown



And the path to follow to the great unknown

Where the dark has fallen and the seed is sown



In the selfish hearts of some

The nightmare's coming

With the spilling blood of others

Now wringing through



Now the cup is spilling over

Wake to news of death

And the prophecy of sages

Destiny is met



To the depths of human mind

The cry is burning

With the mentor's anger

Of the lesson ringing true



And for those who live by and are dying by the sword

They will take their ideals with them

Justify their end



Where the fools are lying and the meek are crying

Where the wolves are preying

On the weak alone



Where the sons are dying

Hear their mothers crying

And the distant sound of fire

Begins again



Never ending the desires of men

It'll never be the same or calm again

In a time of changing hearts

And great unknown

It'll be the damnation and end of us all



Where the fools are lying

And the meek are crying

Where the wolves are preying

On the weak alone



Where the sons are dying

Hear their mothers crying

And the distant sound of fire begins again



Never ending the desires of men

It'll never be the same or calm again

In a time of changing hearts

And great unknown

It'll be the damnation and of end of us all



When the world has fallen and we stand alone...




4. The Red And The Black

[Harris]



The morals of life and the perils of death

Take the wrong way out, running out of breath

Meet my match in the afterlife

Suppress the demons that plague the night



A tortured mind is a safe place to go

But the truth lurks down in the dark below

Step inside my inquisitive mind

Are you scared at what you just might find?



See myself in the hall of mirrors

A different shape every step I take

A different mind every step of the line

But in the end they are all mine



Laughing sorrow inside your head

Can't get out, just a feeling of dread

I know this burden is a heavy load

A dark mistake, never ending road



The black jack king and the red queen clash

The artful dodger, he counts his stash

The joker's wild like an impish child

While Madame Fortune, she waits inside



The good luck charm is overkill

The tired old soldier says fire at will

Planes overhead go search, destroy

The ones below human decoy



I need somebody to save me



Meanwhile we play the waiting game

The clock is struck, the horse is lame

And when we think that this is done

Chance your luck a four leafed one



You hedge your bets, the battle lost

To wait in vain and count the cost

The thin edged line

Between good and bad

And cast the luck, be happy, sad



I need somebody to save me



The red and the black

People don't want the truth

Look in their eyes and you send them away



The red and the black

Fate and hypocrisy

Burden's a heavy load there is no doubt



The red and the black

All out of luck again

How many chances can anyone have?



The red and the black

Treachery out to win

There in the wrong place and at the wrong time



I need somebody to save me




5. When The River Runs Deep

[Smith / Harris]



Look for something that is hard to find

Searching somewhere deep inside your mind

Hope you find just what you're looking for

Heaven's waiting with an open door



If you should sell your soul as cheaply as I did then

The road to ruin is a long road to hide in

We signed our lives away to have an escape

It's something that will be whatever our fate



There's no use in hiding

Got to keep on trying

Can't take no more lying

This is the last



There's no time for crying

When some of us are dying

None of us decide what is our fate



Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere

Take my chances and stand by their sides

When the river runs deep

And the line breaks

And the blood it flows

Free from our lives



Is this the last together? maybe this time now

We stand together and we're holding the line here

There's nothing we can do just sit here and wait

The die is cast that is deciding our fate



There's no use in hiding

Got to keep on trying

Can't take no more lying

This is the last



There's no time for crying

When some of us are dying

None of us decide what is our fate



Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere

Take my chances and stand by their sides

When the river runs deep

And the line breaks

And the blood it flows

Free from our lives



Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere

Take my chances and stand by their sides

When the river runs deep

And the line breaks

And the blood it flows

Free from our lives



Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere

Take my chances and stand by their sides

When the river runs deep

And the line breaks

And the blood it flows

Free from our lives



Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere

Take my chances and stand by their sides

When the river runs deep

And the line breaks

And the blood it flows

Free from our lives




6. The Book Of Souls

[Gers / Harris]



Sacrifices buried with kings

Accompany them on a journey with no end

To an afterlife that's rich with fruit of all the gods

And to face the demons

Of their underworld haunts



The sentient is sent to seek out all the truth

A flight to Earth that is a given from his birth

To rise from ashes of the dead

Out of the fire is sent to fulfill man's desire



By power day and night and death he ruled them

The sky and earth and the fires too

Two-headed reptile symbol of his reign

Universes of the underworld



A life that's full of all the wealth and riches

Can never last for an eternity

After living in a golden paradise

The ultimate sacrifice



Prophecy of sky gods

The sun and moon

Passing of old ways will come true soon



Falling of ages

Forest of kings

The search for truth, the book of souls



The rulers of planets and stars

The power of the kings, of traders and the wars

Planetary cycles and the phases of the moon

Is in the document a kingdom they will learn



They were praying to the gods of nature

And were living in the cities of stone

Towers reaching upward to the heavens

Sacred wonders for the world unknown



Make their lives be a mystery no more

Records kept and the passing of laws

Sacred gods to the book of lies

When a civilization dies



Prophecy of sky gods

The sun and moon

Passing of old ways will come true soon



Falling of ages

Forest of kings

The lost book of souls, destruction begins



Ascending the throne wearing feathers and shells

He brought back their lives from the void

Alien invasion brings nothing but death

Mass exodus and plant life destroyed



Domain of the earth to the journey of truth

The underworld caves Mayan slaves



Defeat of the dark lords

The ultimate proof

In the place where the ancestors rule



The book of souls




7. Death Or Glory

[Smith / Dickinson]



I see the enemy, I know he can't see me

Combat red in tooth and claw

Ready now for one more score



Took a bullet in my brain

Inside I'm the king of pain

Outside you will fear my name

I ride a blood red triplane



Turn like the devil

Shoot straight from the sun

Climb like a monkey

Out of hell where I belong



Death or glory

It's all the same

Death or glory

The price of fame



Death or glory, I'm in the game of

Death or glory, a one way train



I watch you spiral down

Dead before you hit the ground

Bullet got you in the back

Deflection shooting beam attack



I shoot the gunner first

I kill to quench my thirst

I hunt the weakest prey

Live to fly another day



Turn like the devil

Shoot straight from the sun

Climb like a monkey

Out of hell where I belong



Death or glory

It's all the same

Death or glory

The price of fame



Death or glory

I'm in the game of

Death or glory

A one way train



Turn like the devil

Shoot straight from the sun

Climb like a monkey

Out of hell where I belong



Death or glory

It's all the same

Death or glory

The price of fame



Death or glory

I'm in the game of

Death or glory

A one way train



Death or glory

It's all the same

Death or glory

The price of fame



Death or glory

I'm in the game of

Death or glory

A one way train




8. Shadows Of The Valley

[Gers / Harris]



Wandering aimlessly in a cold dark mist I follow

Walking in a dark world that's been

Kissed with sadness

Without sunlight things are born

To the dead of nightmares

Soulless demons laughing in a sea of madness



Listen closely to the raven's call

Praying hard for our world not to end

Try as might to make sense of it all

Will it be for the penance of men

Follow north for the call of the wild

Look all out for a small wayward child

Lay in fear as the dark raven crows

Look for guidance from the one who knows

He lived on this earth for a time and a half

Playing a tune to the old man's laugh

The fear that's inside the men of the oath

In the script of the book that he wrote



Ask them the questions

Tell them no lies

A cry for freedom

Praying that they wouldn't die

Mind over matter

Cry over sins

Their lives are over now

Ended before they begin



As the raven again passes by

I can hear all the wake fathers cry

That the first born of all men will die

That their lives will be taken from them

Face the danger a battle of wills

Strength and courage a cure for all ills

We believe in that thou shall not kill

But others are ready to spill

The hearts of all men since beginning of time

Living with temptation

Wanting and crime

A walk in the shadow of the valley of death

Knowing I'll take my last breath



Ask them the questions

Tell them no lies

A cry for freedom

Praying that they wouldn't die

Mind over matter

Cry over sins

Their lives are over now

Ended before they begin



The hearts of all men since beginning of time

Living with temptation

Wanting and crime

A walk in the shadow of the valley of death

Knowing I'll take my last breath



Ask them the questions

Tell them no lies

A cry for freedom

Praying that they wouldn't die

Mind over matter

Cry over sins

Their lives are over now

Ended before they begin



Into the valley of death fear no evil

We will go forward no matter the cost

Into the valley of death follow me now

Bring me your souls and I'll make it our last



Ask them the questions

Tell them no lies

A cry for freedom

Praying that they wouldn't die

Mind over matter, cry over sins

Their lives are over now

Ended before they begin




9. Tears Of A Clown

[Smith / Harris]



All alone in a crowded room

He tries to force a smile

The smile it beamed or so it seemed



But never reached the eyes, disguise

Masquerading as the funny man do they despise



The false smile maketh of the man

Glass empty or half full

Try to make some sense or sorrows drown



All looks well on the outside

Underneath the solemn truth

There's something that inside has died



Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes

But the cloud remains the same

Wonder why he's feeling down

Tears of a clown



Maybe it's all just for the best

Lay his weary head to rest

Was forever feeling drowned

Tears of a clown



Who motivates the motivator?

FaÃ§ade it has to go

He knows it sooner or later

Smile for the camera, all OK

But tomorrow is another day he must get through



He had a longer way to run

Or so the story goes

Life full of fun where did it go



We saw the sadness in his eyes

It came as no surprise

And now of course we'll never know



Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes

But the cloud remains the same

Wonder why he's feeling down

Tears of a clown



Maybe it's all just for the best

Lay his weary head to rest

Was forever feeling drowned

Tears of a clown



Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes

But the cloud remains the same

Wonder why he's feeling down

Tears of a clown



Maybe it's all just for the best

Lay his weary head to rest

Was forever feeling down

Tears of a clown



Tear of a clown...




10. The Man Of Sorrows

[Murray / Harris]



Like a man without a home

Watching people come and go

Carry on their daily lives

Without a thought for the ones alone



Cast the dream aside like throwing

A pebble into the ocean tide

And I'm feeling so alone again



Free the angry from their pain

Free the captives from their chains

Cast aside the doubt that

Nothing good can come their way again



Living in a world of lies

No matter how or hard we try

Living life without a dream today



Looking through a mist of truth

That we believe an elusive cloud

The things we find are hard to say now

That we live through day to day

Find it hard to force the reasons

Why we find it hard to die



Now we need to know the truth now

Open our eyes that we can see

So we live and breathe again

Better days for you and me

Can we even hope to deliver this

We are so far away



As one turns against the other

With a brother against brother

Situation like no other

It's a picture of despair



As we look to see the man of sorrows

Passing knowledge to those who don't know

As we watch all our friends passing over

As they pass through the edges of time



And we see what's ahead that awaits us

That no longer do we feel afraid

So we look to see the man of sorrows

And the light is the darkness no more



As we look to see the man of sorrows

Passing knowledge to those who don't know

As we watch all our friends passing over

As they pass through the edges of time



And we see what's ahead that awaits us

That no longer do we feel afraid

So we look to see the man of sorrows

And the light is the darkness no more




11. Empire Of The Clouds

[Dickinson]



To ride the storm, to an empire of the clouds

To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost

To ride the storm, to a kingdom that will come

To ride the storm, and damn the rest, oblivion



Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars

Gray Lady, giant of the skies, you hold them in your arms

"The millionth chance," they laughed, "to take down His Majesty's craft."

"To India," they say, "magic carpet float away," an October fateful day



Mist is in the trees, stone sweats with the dew

The morning sunrise, red before the blue

Hanging at the mast, waiting for command

His majesty's airship, the R101



She's the biggest vessel built by man, a giant of the skies

For all you unbelievers, the Titanic fits inside

Drum roll tight, her canvas skin, silvered in the sun

Never tested with the fury, with a beating yet to come



The fury yet to comeâ¦.



In the gathering gloom, the storm rising in the West

The Coxswain stared into the plunging weather glass

We must go now, we must take our chance with fate

We must go now, for a politician, he can't be late



The airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch,

But the ship is in their backbone, every sinew, every inch

She never flew at full speed, a trial never done

Her fragile outer cover, her Achilles would become

An Achilles yet to come...



Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed

Loyal to the king, and an airship creed

The engines drum, the telegraph sounds

Release the cords that bind us to the ground



Said the Coxswain, "Sir, she's heavy, she'll never make this flight."

Said the Captain, "Damn the cargo! We'll be on our way tonight."

Groundlings cheered in wonder, as she backed off from the mast

Baptizing them her water, from the ballast fore and aft

Now she slips into our pastâ¦



[Instrumental section starts with all instruments playing SOS Morse code]



[Solos: Murray, Smith]



Fighting the wind as it rolls you,

Feeling the diesels that push you along

Watching the Channel below you,

Lower and lower, into the night



Lights are passing below you

Northern France, asleep in their beds

Storm is raging around you,

A million to one, that's what he said



Reaper standing beside her

With his scythe cuts to the bone

Panic to make a decision

Experienced men, asleep in their graves



Her cover is ripped and she's drowning

Rain is flooding into the hull

Bleeding to death and she's falling

Lifting gas is draining away



"We're down lads!" came the cry, bow plunging from the sky

Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die

The flares to guide her path ignited at the last

The empire of the clouds, just ashes in our past

Just ashes at the lastâ¦



Here lie their dreams as I stand in the sun

On the ground where they built, and the engines did run

To the moon and the stars, now what have we done?

Oh, the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on



Dreams live on

Dreams live on



Now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the east

The empire of the clouds may rest in peace

And in a country churchyard, laid head to the mast

Eight and forty souls, who came to die in Franceâ¦
