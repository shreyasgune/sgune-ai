1. Satellite 15... The Final Frontier

[Smith / Harris]



I try to call the Earth's command

Desperation in my voice

I'm drifting way off course now

With very little choice



The loneliness is hard to bear

I try to calm my fear

Just hoping any second now

Some contact filters through



Desperate calls...

Signal back from Satellite

As my life flashes right in front of me



Try again...must get through

Hear me now...

For I've very little time



Not much time...hear my call

Please get through...I am here



I'm stranded in space, I'm lost without trace

I haven't a chance of getting away

Too close to the sun, I surely will burn

Like Icarus before me or so legend goes

I think of my life, reliving the past

There's nothing but wait 'til my time comes

I've had a good life, I'd do it again

Maybe I'll come back some time, my friends



For I have lived my life to the full

I have no regrets

But I wish I could talk to my family

To tell them one last goodbye



The final frontier

The final frontier

The final frontier

The final frontier



If I could survive to live one more time

I wouldn't be changing a thing at all

Done more in my life than some do in ten

I'd go back and do it all over again



For I have lived my life to the full

I have no regrets

But I wish I could talk to my family

And tell them that one last goodbye



The final frontier [x4]



[Guitar solo]



There isn't much time, must say my last rites

Nobody is here to read them to me

Must say my goodbyes, if only a line

A message to tell them in case they might find



For I have lived my life to the full

I have no regrets

But I wish I could talk to my family

To tell them that one last goodbye



The final frontier, the final frontier [x2]




2. El Dorado

[Smith / Harris / Dickinson]



Gotta tell you a story

On a cold winter's night

You'll been sailing for glory

Before you know what is right



So come over here now

I've got a vision for you

It's my personal snake oil

It's just something I do



I'm the Jester with no tears

And I'm playing on your fears

I'm a trickster smiling underneath this mask of love and death

The eternal lie I've told

About the pyramids of gold

I've got you hooked at every turn, your money's left to burn



You'll be wanting a contract. Ha!

You'll be waiting a while

I'd like to keep you my contact

But that isn't my style

Well, you'll only get one chance

And it's too good to miss

If I didn't lie to you

Then I wouldn't exist



Greed, lust, and envy pry

It's the same old same old way

The smoke and mirrors

Visions that you see are just like me

I'm a clever banker's face

With just a little out of place

I know someone just like you knows someone just like me



El Dorado come and play

El Dorado step this way

Take a ticket for the ride



El Dorado streets of gold

See the ship it's oversold

You've got one last chance to try



So gone is the glory

And gone is the gold

Well if you need a story

I'll come, it has to be told



Well you may say I'm a devil

And I wouldn't say no

But out here on the dark side

Hey! On with the show!



So now my tale is told

Big and bad and twice as bold

The ship of fools is sinking as the cracks begin to grow

There is no easy way

For an honest man today

Which is something you should think of as my lifeboat sails away



El Dorado come and play

El Dorado step this way

Take a ticket for the ride



El Dorado streets of gold

See the ship it's oversold

You've got one last chance to try



El Dorado come and play

El Dorado step this way

Take a ticket for the ride



El Dorado streets of gold

See the ship it's oversold

You've got one last chance to try




3. Mother Of Mercy

[Smith / Harris]



Sitting waiting in the falling rain

Getting ready to begin again



Wounded lying, crying, bodies moving, dying

All around there is the smell of death and fire



Here the planes are coming

Hear the soldiers running

Killing on a scale to comprehend



Why are we here

In this place...here to kill

Please God forgive us for

What we have done



I always thought I was doing right

As of now I'm not feeling so sure



I'm at a place where

I give no grace

I'm a soldier of war



I sit waiting for my darkest hour to come

I cannot think about the things that I have done

It shouldn't take a fool to see that I believe

Accept the consequence, repent for what I've done



You tell me what is certain but I'll tell you what is true

You tell me what is honesty, when all around is death and cruelty

The making of a man is fire, not giving into our desires

Within the truth it lies within the only thing



Mother of Mercy

Angel of death desire

Mother of mercy

Taking my last breath of fire

Mother of mercy

Angel of pain

Mother of mercy

Taking my last breath



Some say you are a lost cause, some say you're a saint

Just being here's an act of suffering and restraint

Walk down the long dark road to ruin and panic not

I'll die a lonely death of

That I'm certain of



Rivers flow with blood there's nowhere left to hide

It's hard to comprehend there's anyone left alive

Sick of all the killing and the reek of death

Will god tell me what religion is to man

I don't hold with bad religion understand what's underneath it

Now I come to think of it, I just don't hold at all you know it

You say you are a holy man, but what is it you do

From where I stand is nothing but a hollow man I see



Mother of Mercy

Angel of death desire

Mother of mercy

Taking my last breath of fire

Mother of mercy

Angel of pain

Mother of mercy

Taking my last breath



Mother of Mercy

Angel of death desire

Mother of mercy

Taking my last breath of fire

Mother of mercy

Angel of pain

Mother of mercy

Drawing my last breath



I'm just a lonely soldier fighting in a bloody hopeless war

Don't know what I'm fighting, who it is, or what I'm fighting for

Thought it was for money, make my fortune, now I'm not so sure

Seem to just have lost my way




4. Coming Home

[Smith / Harris / Dickinson]



When I stand before you shining in the early morning sun

When I feel the engines roar and I think of what we've done

Oh the bittersweet reflection as we kiss the earth goodbye

As the waves and echoes of the towns become the ghosts of time



Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes

No creed and no religion just a hundred winged souls

We will ride this thunderbird, silver shadows on the earth

A thousand leagues away, our land of birth



To Albion's land

Coming home when I see the runway lights

In the misty dawn the night is fading fast

Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align

Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay



Curving on the edge of daylight til it slips into the void

Waited in the long night, dreaming til the sun is born again

Stretched the fingers of my hand, covered countries with my span

Just a lonely satellite, speck of dust and cosmic sand



Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes

Through the dark Atlantic; over mounting stormy waves

We will ride this thunderbird, silver shadows on the earth

A thousand leagues away, our land of birth



To Albion's land

Coming home when I see the runway lights

In the misty dawn the night is fading fast

Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align

Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay



To Albion's land

Coming home when I see the runway lights

In the misty dawn the night is fading fast

Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align

Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay



Coming home, far away when I see the runway lights

In the misty dawn the night is fading fast

Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align

Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay




5. The Alchemist

[Gers / Harris / Dickinson]



Stranger than the comet as it streaks across the sky

Stranger than the truth I know before my open eyes

I have dealt in mysteries and trickery, of light to entertain

Looked into the abyss, called it by its name



I have plundered time itself, put the world inside it

And the mysteries, day and night, divide it

A plague of wonders, on your knees beside me

Know the secrets, you shall not deride us



My dreams of empire for my frozen queen

Will come to pass

Know me, the Magus

I am Dr. Dee

And this is my house



I am the master of the tides

I shame the mirror in my sight

What random music of the spheres across the years



Know this I will return to this land

Rebuild where the ruins did stand

Chain of the demons set free

Strange alchemy



Gather round the aimless and the feckless and the lame

Hear the master summon up the spirits by their names

I curse you Edward Kelly your betrayal for eternity is damned

Know you speak with demons you cannot command



Even as I looked into the glass then I was blinded

Burning by the Mortlake shore my house my books inside it

You have taken up my wife and lain beside her

Now the black rain on my house, the timbers burning



My dreams of empire for my frozen queen

Will come to pass

Know me, the Magus

I am Dr. Dee

And this was my house



I was the keeper of the books

I had the knowledge of the scrolls

But now through ignorance and fear

I cast a shadow through the years



Know this I will return to this land

Rebuild where the ruins did stand

Chain of the demons set free

Strange alchemy



Know this

I will return to this land

Rebuild where the ruins did stand

Chain of the demons set free

Strange alchemy



Know this

I will return to this land

Rebuild where the ruins did stand

Restore the knowledge memory

Strange alchemy




6. Isle Of Avalon

[Smith / Harris]



I can hear them floating on the wind

Immortal souls their weeping saddens me

Mother earth you know your time is near

Awaken lust the seed is sown and reaped



Through the western isle I hear the dead awaken

Rising slowing to the court of Avalon

The cauldron of the head of Annwyn laced with envy

Dark around its edge with pearl and destiny



All my days I've waited for the sign

The one that brings me closer to isle of Avalon

I can feel the power flowing through my veins

My heart is beating louder, close to Avalon



I can hear you, can you hear me?

I can feel you, can't you feel me?



Fertility Mother Goddess

Celebration, sow the seeds of the born

The fruit of her body laden

Through the corn doll

You will pray for them all

The image of Mother Goddess

Lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead

The sheaf of the corn is broken

End the harvest

Throw the dead on the pyre



I hear her crying the tears of an angel

The voices I hear in my head

Blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth

Mother earth holy blood of the dead



Mother earth I can hear you

Sacrifice, now united



Rising levels of the tidal lakes protect them

Keepers of the goddess in the underworld

Holding powers of the mystics, deep inside them

nineteen maidens, guardians of the otherworld

Mortal conflict born of Celtic legend

That apart from seven, non-returned from Avalon



Mother earth I can feel you

My rebirth now completed



Fertility mother goddess

Celebration, sow the seeds of the born

The fruits of her body laden

Through the corn doll

You will pray for them all

The image of mother goddess

Lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead

The sheaf of the corn is broken

End the harvest, throw the dead on the pyre



To have the belief of others

Looking for the Isle to show them a sign

Fertility of all mothers

Stood in silence

Waiting now for their turn



The gateway to Avalon

The island where the souls of the dead are reborn

Brought here to die and be transferred into the earth

And then for rebirth



I hear her crying the tears of an angel

The voices I hear in my head

Blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth

Mother earth holy blood of the dead



The water in rivers and rhymes rises quickly

Are flowing and flooding the land

The sea shall return once again just to hide them

Lost souls on the Isle of the dead




7. Starblind

[Smith / Harris / Dickinson]



Take my eyes the things I've seen in this world coming to an end

My reflection fades, I'm weary of these earthly bones and skin

You may pass through me and leave no trace, I have no mortal face

Solar winds are whispering, you may hear me call



We can shed our skins and swim into the darkened void beyond

We will dance among the world that orbit stars that aren't our sun

All the oxygen that trapped us in a carbon spider's web

Solar winds are whispering, you may hear the sirens of the dead



Left the elders to their parley meant to satisfy our lust

Leaving Damocles still hanging over all their promised trust

Walk away from freedoms offered by their jailers in their cage

Step into the light startripping over mortals in their rage



Starblind - with sun

The stars are one

We are the light that brings the end of night



Starblind - with sun

The stars are one

We are, with the Goddess of the sun tonight



The preacher loses face with Christ

Religion's cruel device is gone

Empty flesh and hallow bones

Make pacts of love but die alone



The crucible of pain will forge

The blanks of sin, begin again

You are free to choose a life to live

Or one that's left to lose



Virgins in the teeth of God are meat and drink to feed the damned

You may pass through me and I will feel the life that you live less

Step into my light startripping, we will rage against the night

Walk away from comfort offered by your citizens of death



Starblind - with sun

The stars are one

We are the light that brings the end of night



Starblind - with sun

The stars are one

We're one with the goddess of the sun tonight



Take my eyes for what I've seen

I will give my sight to you

You are free to choose whatever

Life to live or life to lose



Whatever God, you know

He knows you, better than you believe

In your once and future grave

You'll fall endlessly deceived



Look into our face reflected in the moon glow in your eyes

Remember you can choose to look but not to see and waste your hours

You believe you have the time but I tell you your time is short

See your past and future all the same and it cannot be bought



Starblind - with sun

The stars are one

We are the light that brings the end of night



Starblind - with sun

The stars are one

We're one with the Goddess of the sun tonight



Take my eyes for what I've seen

I will give my sight to you

You are free to choose whatever

Life to live or life to lose



Whatever God you know

He knows you better than you believe

In your once and future grave

You'll fall endlessly deceived



The preacher loses face with Christ

Religion's cruel device is gone

Empty flesh and hollow bones

Make pacts of love but die alone



The crucible of pain will forge

The blanks of sin, begin again

You are free to choose a life to live

Or one that's left to lose




8. The Talisman

[Gers / Harris]



When I stand and look about the port

And contemplate my life,

Will I ever see my countrymen again?



As the captain calls us on the deck

I take my things and walk to the harbourside,

I glance back one last time



Fleeing our nation,

Our problems we leave behind

Ships by the tenfold

Sail out on the tide

We are pleased to be out and

Embracing the open sea

Free from our troubles

And more free from thee



Inheritors unfulfilled reason

Behind us.

We flee from what is not what

Is will be.

We flee the earth and face our

Harsh reality.

Will death be low mist that

Hangs on the sea?



We run from the evil tongues,

Rash judgements, selfish men

Never to be seen on these shores again.



As we sail into oceansize

And lose sight of all land

A face of contentment

Around in the air

We're off now to seek all our fortunes

To the land of our dreams



Riding the waves and the storm

Is upon us.

The winds lash the sails but

The ropes keep them tight



Off in the distance a dark cloud approaching

None could imagine what there was to come



No, there's no one going back

No, there's not a second chance

As we strap onto the side

We pray to God that we won't die



As we ride the rough seas,

As we soak from the ocean waves,

I just hope for all our lives

And pray that I survive



Four ships are lost in the

Stormy conditions

The spirits of the sunken crews,

Their phantoms follow us



Spirits, sails, they drive us on

Through the all consuming waves

Cold mortality, no weapon

Against these ever raging seas



Four leagues and ten and we

Hit storms again

We just can't get away from

The eye of the storm



The birds outsoar the raging storm

But we cannot escape it

Abandoned earth that we now crave

Is many leagues from safe



Holding on for our dear lives

And we're praying once again

rotten luck or just jonahed?

The talisman is in my hand



Limbs fatigues, trembling with cold

Blinded from the sea spray salt

Clasping anything we can hold

Heaven's rain upon us falls



Twenty days without a meal

And ten without fresh water still

Those that didn't die in storms

The scurvy rest did slaughter



Westwards the tide

westwards we sail on

Westwards the tide

Sail by the talisman



We approach the other side

Of the ocean with the tide

In our favour just for once

Welcome greeting our new land

The elation in our hearts

The excitement in our veins

As we sail towards the coastline

Of our golden promised land



Weary limbs fatigued away

I have no life left in me

No more strength and nothing

Left to give

Must find the will to live



Never thought that we could make it

Truly sight of shores divine

the sickness I am dying from

Never wanted it to end this way



Westwards the tide

Westwards we sail on

westwards the tide

Sail by the talisman




9. The Man Who Would Be King

[Murray / Harris]



As he travels on the beast of Burden

Moving up along the mountain side

As he gazes looking down the valley

No regrets but his pride



As he journeys across mountain passes

And significant sweeps overhand

His reflection of the beauty around him

Feeling empty inside



He is running from his wildest thoughts

He is running from his everything

He is looking now to find something

Hoping he could be saved



He's searching for the answer now

Is something that he's managed to avoid up 'till now

Looking for the conviction that he craves

He needs to find the answer sooner or later



Pushed himself to the limits

He had to strife for all the harder things in life

But what the cost to give him now

His life and time are the only things that he has



Life is is not a rehearsal, only has this the one chance to get it right

Living really is only way to know

Maybe one day they ll forgive him what he's done

with all the pain of lying too early in the grave



Destiny, no good to hide away

Penance now will be his only way

Understand, no good to run away

Penance now will be his saving grace



Just to make his peace with God

All is forgivable but he's left a little late

Trying something that he's not

Is impossible to change such a lot



He's taken someone s life away

There s not a day that goes by he regrets what he's done

He should have found another way

From the good book says an eye for an eye



In reflecting on decisions that were made

On the judgements that will haunt him  till his grave

No-one has the right to take another life

But in his mind he had no choice so be it



Destiny, no good to hide away

Penance now will be his only way

Understand, no good to run away

Penance now will be his saving grace



Destiny, no good to hide away

Hear us now, we ll be his only way

understand , no good to run away

Hear us now, we ll be his saving grace



Far, far away

The man who would be king

Far, far away

The man who would be king




10. When The Wild Wind Blows

[Harris]



Have you heard what they said on the news today?

Have you heard what is coming to us all?

That the world as we know it will be coming to an end

Have you heard, have you heard?



He sees them in the distance where the darkened clouds roll

He could feel tension in the atmosphere

He would look in the mirror, see an old man now

Does it matter they survive somehow?



They said there's nothing can be done about the situation

They said there's nothing you can do at all

To sit and wait around for something to occur

Did you know, did you know?



As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows

And wonders if they'll ever grow again

The desperation of the situation getting graver

Getting ready when the wild wind blows



Have you seen what they said on the news today?

Have you heard what they said about us all?

Do you know what is happening to just every one of us

Have you heard, have you heard?



There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen

There will be something that will light the sky

That the world as we know it, it will never be the same

Did you know, did you know?



He carries everything into the shelter not a fuss

Getting ready when the moment comes

He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two

Good to have because you never know



They tell us nothing that we don't already know about

They tell us nothing that is real at all

They only fill us with the stuff that they want

Did you know, did you know?



He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day

He's getting tired that'll do for now

They are preparing for the very worst to come to them

Getting ready when the wild wind blows



He sees the picture on the wall, it's falling down upside down

He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face, saying grace

Remember times they had, they flash right through his mind left behind

Of a lifetime spent together long ago will be gone



They've been preparing for some weeks now

For when the crucial moment comes

To take their refuge in the shelter

Let them prepare for what will come



They make a tea and sit there waiting

They're in the shelter feeling snug

Not long to wait for absolution

Don't make a fuss; just sit and wait



Can't believe all the lying,

All the screams are denying

That the moments of truth have begun



Can't you see it on the TV?

Don't believe them in the least bit

Now the days of our ending have begun



Say a prayer when it's all over

Survivors unite all as one

Got to try and help each other

Got the will to overcome



I can't believe all the lying,

All the screens are denying

That the moments of truth have begun



Can't you see it on the TV?

Don't believe them in the least bit

Now the days of our ending have begun



When they found them, had their arms wrapped around each other

Their tins of poison laying near by their clothes

The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout,

Just another when the wild wind blows...
