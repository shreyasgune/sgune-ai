1. Wasted Years

From the coast of gold, across the seven seas

I'm travellin' on, far and wide

But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself

And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but

someone else



I close my eyes, and think of home

Another city goes by in the night

Ain't it funny how it is, you never miss it 'til it's

gone away

And my heart is lying there and will be 'til my

dying day



So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for

those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

And realise you're living in the golden years



Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind

Can't ease this pain, so easily

When you can't find the words to say it's hard to

make it through another day

And it makes me wanna cry and throw my

hands up to the sky



So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for

those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

And realise you're living in the golden years



[Solo]



So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for

those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

And realise you're living in the golden years

[Repeat]




2. Reach Out

It's over your head

And you don't seem to understand

One word I say

And you can't live your life

Trying to run away



You're fighting your friends

Arguing every point

But it never ends

You're wearing me out



Come on

Reach out (Reach out)

And let somebody into your life



Don't get me wrong

You always apologize

It's just your way

Of making a scene

You need to be loved

It's not such a crime



Come on

Reach out (Reach out)

And let somebody into your life

Come on

Reach out (Reach out)

And let somebody into your life



[Solo]



Over your head

You just don't seem to understand

One word I say

And you can't live your life

You got so much love

It's burning inside



Come on

Reach out (Reach out)

And let somebody into your life

Come on

Reach out (Reach out)

And let somebody into your life

Reach out (Reach out)

And let somebody into your life




3. Sheriff Of Huddersfield

Life in a city living in L.A.

Is a long way from Huddersfield town

The back of the Rainbow's a long way from heaven

But that's where he gets his pork pie

Limos and ladies they're driving him queasy

Rugby and cricket's unknown

Baseball and football they're making him lazy

Your fan club says "Rodney come home"



The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle

Look down on Hollywood Hills

The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle

You're our own Hot Rod on wheels



A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels

The Nautilus rusts in the yard

But for Yorkshire he's yearning but because he's earning

He'll always live in L.A.

A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket

And never comes out to pay bills

He's winning at poker and playing the Joker

And he always cheats when he deals



The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle

Look down on Hollywood Hills

The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle

You're our own Hot Rod on wheels



[Rodney's rap:]

Hello, let me introduce myself!

My name is Rodney. I'm immensely strong.

When I were a lad, I could lift up five

Navies on an end of a shovel.

The reason I never took martial arts because

I was immensely fearsome and

I'd probably kill everybody

I came into contact with it.

I was phenomenally strong.

Pride and ego, my lads, pride and ego,

Is what makes the world rotate.

And everybody knows the centre of the universe is Huddersfield

But I don't live there anymore.

I live in Los Angeles.

It's great!... I think



Rufus the red has a crane by his bed

To wrench himself up in the morn'

But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed

You'll wish you'd never been born.

A bear with a sore head we mean your forehead

He slumbers for most of the day

Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast

Your problem Rodney L.A.



The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle

Look down on Hollywood Hills

The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle

You're our own Hot Rod on wheels
